    "text": "5. Prescription medicine   The amount of money drug companies spend on TV ads has doubled in recent years. And it’s no wonder. Studies show the commercials work. Consumers go to their doctor with a suggestion for a prescription drug they saw advertised on TV. Now a study in the Annals of Family Medicine raises questions about the message these ads promote in pairs patty Neiman reports. You’re most likely to see drug ads during prime time, especially around the news. Researchers analyzed 38 ads aimed at people with conditions like hypertension, herpes, high cholesterol, depression, arthritis and allergies. The drug industry says these ads arm consumers with information, but researchers found that though the information was technically accurate, the tone was misleading. UCLA psychologist Dominic frosh headed the study. What we would see in these ads is that before taking a prescription drug, the character’s life was out of control and the loss of control really extended beyond the impact of the health condition. For example, herpes patients were portrayed as being incapacitated for days. Insomniacs utterly out of synch on the job and depressed patients were friendless and boring at parties. When the character has been shown taking the drug, he’d been magically regained complete control of his life. None of the ads of course mentioned lifestyle changes that could also help treat the condition after all it’s mass marketing but in this case frosh says prescription medications are not like soap."
