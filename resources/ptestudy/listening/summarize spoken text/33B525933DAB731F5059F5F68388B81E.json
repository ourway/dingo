    "text": "Before we discuss political systems however it’s helpful to address the confusion that has been spread about the political spectrum. Many have been led to believe that the political spectrum places groups such as communists on the far left, fascists or dictators on the far right and political moderates or centrists in the middle. However the more accurate political spectrum will show government having zero power on the far right to having 100% power on the far left. At the extreme right there is no government. The extreme left features total government under such labels as communism, socialism, Nazism, Fascism, Princes, potentates, dictators, kings, any form of Codel government. Those who claim that Nazis and fascists are right-wing never defined their terms. This amount to spreading confusion toward the middle of the political spectrum can be found the type of government limited to its proper role of protecting the rights of the people. That’s where the constitution of the United States is. Those who advocate such a form of government are really constitutional moderates. So let’s analyze the basic forms of government. They are monarchy or dictatorship ruled by one, oligarchy ruled by a few, democracy ruled by a majority, Republic ruled by law and anarchy which is ruled by no one. In discussing these five we’ll see that there can be narrowed down to even fewer."
