We do an annual report which studies how much oil is left in the world and demand for oil. And with China, India, South America, Africa even, growing at the rate they’re now growing, you know, we think that four or five years from now the demand for fuel will exceed supply. That could push prices, you know, through the roof. For that reason you know, forget global warming for one minute just for that reason alone, we should be hurrying up, you know, saving on energy and creating alternative sources of energy. And I think those people who invest in this sector, hopefully, you know, will get their thanks, and get the right; get their just returns."
