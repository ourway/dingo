    "text": "Robert Capa is a name that has for many years been synonymous with war photography. Born in Hungary in 1913 as Friedmann Endire Emo, Capa was forced to leave his native country after his involvement in anti-government protests. Capa had originally wanted to become a writer, but after his arrival in Berlin had first found work as photographer. He later left Germany and moved to France due to the rise in Nazism. He tried to find work as a freelance journalist and it was here that he changed his name to Robert Capa, mainly because he thought it would sound more American. In 1936, after the breakout of the Spanish Civil War, Capa went to Spain and it was here over the next three years that he built his reputation as a war photographer. It was here too in 1936 that he took one of this most famous pictures, The Death of a loyalist Soldier."
