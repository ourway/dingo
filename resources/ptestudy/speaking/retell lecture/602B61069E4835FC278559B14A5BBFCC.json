    "text": "A dimension of space is basically an independent direction in which in principle you could move, you could walk, so we talk about left and right, you can freely move left right, back forth, you can move back forth, up down, you can freely move up down as well. If you consider a diagonal direction, that’s not a new direction because that’s just a combination of moving this way and that way. So when we talk about dimensions, we talk about the independent directions, which you can move. Another way to think about dimensions, they are the data that needs to be specified in order to delineate where something takes place. So if you’re having a dinner party, you give your friend a straight, a cross straight in the floor number, three pieces of information to nail down a location in three dimensions in the space. According to the string theory, in reality you need to give your friend more than just those three pieces of information if you really want him or her to know where to go. You need to tell them coordinates, data, that’s specifies real actual dimensions the dinner party’s taking place, too, but because the actual dimensions we think are so small, it does not matter to your friend whether they show up exactly at the right location and actual dimensions or not because things are not able to penetrate them in any meaningful way. But that’s what dimension would be, it’s a piece of data necessary to delineate where something takes place."
