    "text": "Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plants, algae and some bacteria. Biologically, chlorophyll is one of the most important molecules in the worldâ€™s ecosystem due to being essential to photosynthesis, allowing plants to absorb light. With the aid of chlorophyll, plants use light to synthesise glucose from water and carbon dioxide, releasing oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis. Without chlorophyll, autotrophic primary producers such as plants could not synthetize glucose or oxygen, which most living organisms need to respire. Chlorophyll most strongly absorbs the blue and red portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, while reflecting the green portion, giving chlorophyll its green colour."
