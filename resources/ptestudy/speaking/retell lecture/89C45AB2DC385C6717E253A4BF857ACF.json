The part of your brain that lights up when you see something is actually back here. So if you actually were watching like in my class I’m sure the PowerPoints to die for and so the part of the brain that activated at that moment is way back there. If I’m giving the speech of a lifetime in my students are like more, more, on like this is the part of the brain that lights up, for example, I am just characterizing here interestingly enough if that’s all you did. You are lecturing, you giving presentations, that’s it. There’s a whole bunch of other areas in the brain that does not tend to get activated if what you really do is the kind of traditional didactic approach. So now that other senses, ok, there’s other kind of the senses and if you if processing was involved in the signal kind of spread out further and further. There is classification at the part of the cortex. This deeper areas of the brain by the way, but we’re just looking at the surface which where the high is cognitive function to kind of showing up but you got vision processing back here. You’ve got sound processing back here. There’s kind of a giant swath here that will deal with the sensory perception dealing with touch. Smells tend to be directly kind of on the surface it out of the way. It’s very old part of the cortex underneath there. I’ll and yet we only sort of channel stuff into those areas which it seems extremely can narrow focus."
