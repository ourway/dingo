    "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (sometimes called PTSD) is a form of anxiety disorder. Some people develop this condition after they have experienced a traumatic event. Strong reactions such as fear, horror, anger, sadness and hopelessness are natural after events like these. In most cases, these feelings will pass after the normal working-through of emotions and talking things over in your own time with family, friends or colleagues.Post-traumatic stress disorder is identified by three main groups of symptoms: flashbacks of the traumatic event through intrusive memories or nightmares (there may also be physical symptom such as sweating, heart palpitations or panic attacks); feeling emotionally numb and avoiding situations that are reminders of the trauma (Avoiding possible reminders of the trauma can cause someone to lose interest in day-to-day activities and become detached from friends and family); feeling anxious and ‘jumpy’ for no reason (the affected person is constantly on the lookout for danger, possibly leading to irritability and a lack of concentration)."
