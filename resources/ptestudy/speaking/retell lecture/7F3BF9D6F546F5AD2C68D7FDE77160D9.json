Of course there’s lots of sugar in donuts or ice cream, or pastries, or other things that are sweet; candy of course, but there are other places where you see it and you don’t necessarily expect it. As an example: peanut butter. Here’s a list of ingredients from Skippy Peanut Butter and you see that sugar is the second most common ingredient .You may know from reading food labels that these ingredients in any food label are listed in order of how much there is in the food itself, so sugar comes right after peanuts. Here’s another example, Beef Stew, you wouldn’t necessarily expect to find sugar in beef stew but it’s there. Now it’s down the list of ingredients, it’s actually toward the end, but if you look at the marketing of this and look at the can it says ,there’s fresh potatoes and carrots, but actually there’s more sugar in this than there is carrots. So you wouldn’t eat something like beef stew and expect to find this to be the case. Here’s another example where you have high fructose corn syrup is the source of sugar is in ketchup."
