      "People feel connection to monarchy because it gives them a link to an era gone by and helps them see how the community has changed over time. It is important to have a living sense of history as the anxiety over change is common in Britain.",
      "People feel connection to monarchy because they can take their children to see the monarchy. This helps the community understand how the monarchs have changed and deal with post war anxiety.",
      "People want their children to understand how the monarchy has changed and therefore take them to events related to history. People in Britain are very anxious about the changes.",
      "People want a living link with the past and therefore they like monarchy. This helps their children understand why Britain is anxious after war."

    "text": "I think the reason people feel a connection to monarchy specific is a sort of thing they might take their children to go and see is that you get a profound sense of something that goes back generation and generation and generations and is a living link to a very very different age from the world we now live in and I think people are you know interested and engaged in what that tells us about this place and community and the way that it has changed. So I think people have a sort of historic sense of that. But I think its very important to do what you are suggesting which is to bring out a living sense of history to in our communities and actually have the history of how we changed and what we feel about that. And I think we have too much anxiety about that. And I think this is a particular feature of post war Britain."
