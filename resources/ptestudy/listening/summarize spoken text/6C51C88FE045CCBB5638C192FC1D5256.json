    "text": "A depression in a child dates back as far as the 16th century when the first concept of children’s depression was discovered. A research was taken at that time to find out what happened to children who suffer from depression. The study revealed that the dramatic increase in children depression can increase the risk of life.  For example, longterm illness such as diabetes and heart disease are caused by depression. One of the studies shows children with depression behave differently and respond differently to medical treatment. This is why many specialists have tried to bring a cure, but no one found a perfect medicine. It is quite rare that children suffer from depression, but in the recent study, the number has dramatically increased.  Nowadays no one doubt about children depression. It has become a common sickness in a child. Children’s depression is still a puzzle for scientists and specialists and needs to be resolved sooner than later."
