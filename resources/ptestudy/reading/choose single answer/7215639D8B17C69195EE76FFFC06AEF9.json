    "text": "Modern liberal ideals of ethnic tolerance and diversity are taking hold in many places, but many ethnic-based societies exist where such ideals have yet to gain wide acceptance. Usually, this is the case because one ethnicity is dominant or in the much greater majority. In Japan, the Korean minority is stigmatised and excluded from positions of power in the society. Korean children, if they wish to be accepted by their peers, must attend Japanese schools and make Japanese their first language. They are made to feel ashamed of their Korean ethnic identity and culture."
