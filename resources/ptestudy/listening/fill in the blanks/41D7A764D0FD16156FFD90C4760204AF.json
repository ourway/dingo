    "text": "I’m left-handed myself and I actually didn’t see anyrelevance  to my own life when I happened to start reading anarticle  by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews. He spent the first part of the article talking about handedness  in music instead of sport, which I have to say almost put me off from reading further. But what I soon became struck  by was the sheer volume of both observation and investigation  he had done in many different sports and I felt persuaded  that what he had to say would be of real interest."
