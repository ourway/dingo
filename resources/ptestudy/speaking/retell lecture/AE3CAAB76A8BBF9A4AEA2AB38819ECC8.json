    "text": "We have been together now in this pottery class for several weeks, and I feel you are all doing very well. I thought you might be interested in hearing about a ceramics workshop that will be held here at the college next month. Kate Ferguson, who was recently named by Ceramics Monthly as one of the dozen best potters in the world, will be at the recreation center for an intensive seven-day workshop. Participants in the workshop will, Kate has assure me, make a lot of pots and be able to work closely with her on refining their techniques and skills. Thereâ€™s only room for eighteen potters and advanced pottery students in the workshop, so everyone will get personal attention. It costs $175, which included all your materials, and a picnic, which is usually attended by all of the participants at the end of the workshop. A $50 deposit is required ahead of time, with the rest of the tuition due by May 15th. I should mention that this workshop is cosponsored by the Van Howe Chemical Company, which is donating the clay. If you want to register for the workshop you should call the recreation center at 5553080. You should really consider taking advantage of this opportunity."
