    "text": "The loss of construction jobs by immigrants from Latin America contributed  to a spike in unemployment among all Latino workers to 6.5 percent, compared with 4.7 percent unemployment for non-Latino workers, the report found. As recently as late 2006, Latino workers had achieved their historic low unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, based mainly on a job boom among immigrants, the report said. “To put it bluntly, Hispanics had a rough time in the labor market in 2007,” said Rakesh Kochhar, the author of the report who is associate director for research at the Pew center, a nonpartisan organization in Washington. Job loss was particularly severe for Mexican immigrants whose unemployment rate rose to 8.4 percent from 5.5 percent in 2007, the report found. Of 247,000 jobs lost by Latino workers in theconstruction industry in 2007, workers born in Mexico lost 152,000 jobs, or about 60 percent. Latino workers make up about 14 percent of the United States labor force, and about 52 percent of them are immigrants. The Pew report, which is based on recent data from the census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, does not distinguishbetween legal and illegal immigrants. The banking credit crisis and a drop in home prices led to an abrupt slowdown in new home building last year. Illegal immigrant workers have beenconcentrated  in construction, accounting for 12 percent of employment in that industry, according to a Pew study in 2006. Mexicans account for about of more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, the Pew center has estimated."
