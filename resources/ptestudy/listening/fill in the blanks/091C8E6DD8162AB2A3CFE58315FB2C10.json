    "text": "Medicinal tablets are nothing new. Doctors have been dispensing pills for thousands of years. And now archaeologists have turned up some of those ancient medicines, which were preserved in a shipwreck for close to two millennia. The 2nd-century Pozzino wreck was  discovered in 1974 off the coast of Italy. It’s cargo included medical equipment like a cupping vessel, iron probe, and tin boxes of suppliesAnd in one of those boxes, researchers recovered five gray tablets. Now, they’ve analyzed the antique medication The work is in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The pills primarily containedzinc compounds, probably the active medicinal ingredients. But researchers also detected starch, pollen, charcoal, fats and linen fibers. Those fibers helped the tablets hold their round, loaf-like shape, which may be the key to the medication’s use: the Greek word meaning “small round loaves” alsoinspiredthe word collyrium, or eye-wash. The pills were probably either dissolved in liquid or ground into a powder and used to treat eye conditions. Who knows, maybe Hippocrates used them on his pupils."
