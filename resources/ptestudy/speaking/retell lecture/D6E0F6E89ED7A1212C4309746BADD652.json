Maybe not as complex as all the stuff that we have on earth, but microscopic life like bacteria and other tiny organisms. Yes, there is reason to believe life once existed on Mars. It also means that we potentially have a source of water to drink when we get there because you know we are going there. So, the downside, remember a few months back when there are reports that Mars is covered in poisonous dust. The orange dust is called regolith and it’s full of nasty stuff like perchlorate, which are used here on earth is rocket fueling can mess up your thyroid gland if you expose them also has silicates which can mix with the water in your lungs and turn into chemicals that cause respiratory diseases, so separating the Mars water from all that stuff in the soil is not going to be an easy task but it could be done and it could mean a supply of safe drinking water for future Mars colony."
