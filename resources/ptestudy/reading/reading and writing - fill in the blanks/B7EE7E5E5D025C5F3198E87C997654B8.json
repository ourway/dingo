Most Americans are able to  buysellraceseebuy cars.The average price of a recently made car was ,050 in 1950, , 740 in 1960 and up to , 750 in 1975.During this period American car manufacturers set about improving their products and work efficiency.  As a result, the yearly income of theunusualinterestedaveragebiggest average family increased from 1950 to 1975 faster than the price of cars.For this reason purchasing a new car takes a smaller part of a family’s total earnings today.  In 1951 proportionally it took 8.1 months of an average family’s income to buy a new car.In 1962 a new carusedspendcostneeded cost 8.3 of a family’s annual earnings.By 1975 it only took 4.75 months income.In addition, the 1975 cars were technically superior to models from previous years.  The influence of the automobile extends throughout the economy as the car is so important to Americans.Americans spend more money tostartleavekeeprepair keep their cars running than on any other item."
