    "text": "There once was a guy named Albert Einstein who you have probably heard of. And he developed the equation E=MC2. Which you have probably heard of also. Using this equation the relationship between mass and energy can be calculated using the speed of light, which is a universal constant. But how did scientists determine the speed of light? Philosophers in ancient Greece were the first to think about and debate the speed of light. Way back in the 5th century BCE, Empedocles made the first claim that light had a finite speed. Aristotle, however, disagreed and said that light was instantaneous. Euclid and Ptolemy thought that light came from the eyes which is what enabled sight. This would seem to imply that light must have an infinite speed which allows us to see really distant objects like stars. Immediately upon opening our eyes. Over a thousand years later, the Islamic philosopher Alhazen proposed that light actually travels from an object into our eyes and therefore light has a finite speed. Like six hundred years later, really smart people like Johan Kepler and Rene Descartes were saying that the speed of light must be infinite because there is nothing an empty space to slow it down."
