If there wasn’t a roof on this lecture theatre, then this would be sending out light into the universe. An expanding sphere of light travelling outwards at 300,000 kilometres per second. In one and a half seconds it would have passed by the moon. In eight minutes it would speed past the sun, and in around 100,000 years, it would completely clear the Milky Way Galaxy. Now, I can draw this onto my map. So, this is here and now in this lecture theatre at the Royal Institution. So, I can draw a line on my map that represents the trajectory of a beam of light through space-time. Of course it expands in all directions, so I have another one of those lines going out there. A pair of diagonal lines. Now, I could also draw lines on this map which represent the paths of beams of light from the past, if they arrived here, now, in this lecture theatre. And here they’ll be. They’ll look the same, but they’ll extend out into the past. Now, we all agree on these lines because we all agree on the speed of light, so they must be important in some way. And they are. This is how Einstein protects the past from the future."
