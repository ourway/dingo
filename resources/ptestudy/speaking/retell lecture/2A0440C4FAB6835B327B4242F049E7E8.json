First, we have to review the budget. The president has informed me that the trustees have set aside $3,000 for the purchase of trees and our environmental T-shirt sale netted a profit of $1,500. Second, we have to finalize the choice of trees. As you know, we’re working with Richardson’s Nursery again this year since everyone seemed pleased with the work he did for us last year. Mr. Richardson has presented us with several choices within our price range that he thinks would meet our needs. He’s sent us pictures of the trees for us to look at, but he wanted me to tell you that we’re welcome to visit the nursery if we want to see the trees themselves. Lastly, we need to plan some kind of ceremony to commemorate the planting. Several ideas, including a garden party of some sort, have been suggested. So let’s get on with it and turn to the first order of business."
