    "text": "Thus the environmental policy does not contribute to the profitability in any real sense at all. In practice it is companies that are well organized and efficient, or that are already comfortably profitable, that have time to establish and police environmental policies. However, if profitable companies are the ones most likely to  establish “environmental best practice” this is confusing cause with effect. It is not that environmental best practice causes profitability, but that being profitable allows for concern for the environment."
