    "text": "As yet, the new explanation isincomplete,So far, the researchers have only computed the effects caused,by one property of matter falling into a black hole, its electric charge. They have not shown the effect of its mass, which would also be important. Their calculations,therefore account only for part of the information that is lost. But they have established a principle,that may lead to a full accounting of the matter. That would let physicists sleep easy in their beds, in the knowledge that reality is once again behaving, at least approximately, how they think it ought to."
