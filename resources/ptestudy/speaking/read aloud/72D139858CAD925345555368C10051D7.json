This is a common misconception: the function of a plant is to make the water cleaner, but it’s not clean enough to drink. It could be used in irrigation. What a plant is trying to do is to simply speed up a process which would naturally occur given more time. This means that a plant can create water which is safe to enter back into the water system as it’s so heavily diluted. The river then continues the water purification, acting as a form of fourth stage."
