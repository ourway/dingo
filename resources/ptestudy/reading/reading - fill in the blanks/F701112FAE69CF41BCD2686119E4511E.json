    "text": "For too long we have held preconceived notions of ‘the’ market and ‘the’ state that were seemingly independent of local societies and cultures_ The debate about civil society ultimately is about how culture, market and state  relate to  each other. Concern about civil society, however, is not only relevant to central and eastern Europe and the developing world. It is very much of  interest to  the European Union as well. The Civil Dialogue initiated by the Commission in the 1990s was a first attempt by the EU to give the institutions of society-and not only governments and businesses-a voice at the policy-making tables in Brussels. The EU, like other international institutions, has a long way to go in trying to  accommodate  the frequently divergent interests of non-governmental organizations and citizen groups. There is increasing  recognition  that international and national governments have to open up to civil society institutions."
