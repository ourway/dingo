    "text": "Many kids with moderate retardation are not identified until they enter pre-school and at times not until the 2nd or 3rd grade, when academic work gets more demanding than before. Most children with moderate mental retardation are able to acquire necessary academic skills up to about the 6th grade level and also to learn job skills well enough to help themselves independently or semi-independently. Some adults who have been diagnosed with moderate mental retardation develop brilliant social and communication skills and once they finish school, they are no longer recognized as disabled.Students with mild retardation show considerable delays in development during their early school years. As they grow older, disparities in overall intellectual development and adaptive functioning generally get wider between these kids and peers without disabilities. People with moderate mental retardation are more likely to have behavior and health problems than the ones who do not suffer from mental retardation."
