Your body is also read 10 times that number bacteria call home sweet home. but don’t be afraid these bacteria do more good than harm to you and besides just in case you want to strike up a conversation with your tenants, union bacteria deal have a few things in common. Also share some common characteristics that make them living things. All Organisms are composed of cells the basic fundamental unit of life. They contain DNA as a heritable genetic material, and they can reproduce. They transcribe DNA into RNA and translate RNA into proteins and ribosomes. They can also regulate transport across the cell membrane and require chemical energy from the cyclic processes. The number one biggest difference between bacteria in your body and the cells making up your body are these tiny cellular components called organelles. You’ve actually learned a lot about organelles and other cells without knowing it. Organelles are simply membrane bound compartments within a cell such as the nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplast, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum. You are eukaryotes. Your cells are eukaryotic. Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles including a nucleus. Eukaryotes can be single celled or multicellular such as you, me, plants, fungi, and insects."
