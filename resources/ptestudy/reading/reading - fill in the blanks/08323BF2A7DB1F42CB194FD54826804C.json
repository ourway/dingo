    "text": "Phoenix is adamant that the new course will teach “solid chemistry”, but he thinks that an attraction for students will be a teaching approach that  differs significantly from his days as an undergraduate. This takes real-life issues as the starting point of lectures and modules, such as how drugs are made or the science behind green issues. Out of this study, he says, students will be exposed to exactly the same core chemistry unchanged over decades, but they will be doing it in a way that is more  engaging  and more likely to lead to more fundamental learning."
