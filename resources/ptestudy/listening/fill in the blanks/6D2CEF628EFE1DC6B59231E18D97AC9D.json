    "text": "At supper Johnson talked of good eating with uncommon satisfaction . “Some people,” said he, “have a foolish way of not minding, or pretending not to mind, what they eat. For my part, I mind my belly very studiously  , and very carefully; for I look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else,” He was, for the moment, not only serious but vehement . ” Yet I have heard him, upon other occasions, talk with great contempt of people who were anxious to gratify their palates; and the 206th number of his Rambler is a masterly essay against gulosity . His practice, indeed, I must acknowledge, may be considered as casting the balance of his different opinions upon this subject; for I never knew any man who relished  good eating more than he did."
