    "text": "Discussions on drug addiction should not only be concerned with drug addicts but also with the vast majority of non-addicts. Their family and social lives are insecure as our narcotics laws drive such people to crime. A drug addict is almost never harmful when he is under the influence of drugs. That desperate need for money to buy the next fix makes him dangerous as drugs are available in illegal black markets where prices of such drugs are quite astronomical. The high cost of these drugs drives the drug addict to steal, kill or rob people of their money."
