    "text": "Sharing the learning can save time and can also make it much more enjoyable. There will always be a range of ability and experience within any group, but each person in the group will have the same aim: to reach that level of competence necessary for being accepted for registration as a social worker and to maintain and build on that competence. Ultimately, how well or how badly you do will not impact too much on your fellow students and vice versa and so, as there is no need to be competitive, there is little point in shunning collaboration and joint working. You may have experiences or insights that will aid someone else’s learning, but you could also find something in another’s approach that can inform your own understanding. This reciprocity can help maximise your use of time in direct ways, such as sharing out research tasks and reporting back to group discussions, so that it is not necessary for every student to read every recommended text. Collaborative working can also have indirect benefits in terms of making good use of time, because of the effect it can have on morale and motivation. Some people choose to ‘plough their own furrow’, but it can become a very lonely process and one in which it is easy to become demoralised. Sharing the load with others can be fun, and does not necessarily dilute the learning experience, and so could perhaps be considered to be ‘smart learning’."
