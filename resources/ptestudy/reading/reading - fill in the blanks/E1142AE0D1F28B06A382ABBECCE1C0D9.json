    "text": "One of Australia’s most remarkable natural gifts, the Great Barrier Reef is blessed with the breathtaking beauty of the world’s largest coral reef. The reef contains an  abundance  of marine life and  comprises  of over 3000 individual reef systems and coral cays and literally hundreds of  picturesque  tropical islands with some of the world’s most beautiful sun-soaked, golden beaches. Because of its natural beauty, the Great Barrier Reef has become one of the world’s most  sought  after tourist destinations. A visitor to the Great Barrier Reef can enjoy many experiences  including snorkeling, scuba diving, aircraft or helicopter tours, bare boats (self-sail), glass-bottomed boat viewing, semi-submersibles and educational trips, cruise ship tours, whale watching and swimming with dolphins."
