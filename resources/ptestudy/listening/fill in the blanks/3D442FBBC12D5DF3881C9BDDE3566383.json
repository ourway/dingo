    "text": "One day the banana is perfect. Bright yellow, firm, flavorful. But even within that same day brown spots appear on your perfectly ripe banana, its flesh turns mushy, and it’s destined for the compost or at best, banana bread. But scientists are developing a way toextend the life of ripe bananas. It’s a spray-on coating made from chitosan—a substance found in crab and shrimp shells. The new gel can be sprayed on bananas to slow the ripening process by up to 12 days. Like other fruit bananas remain alive after being  picked and it actually continues to respire. this means that they take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide . the more the banana breathesthe faster it ripens and then rots. Bananas ripen more quickly than most fruit because they don’t naturally slow the respiration after being picked, in fact it speeds up, causing bananas to become mushy. Chitosan not only kills thebacteriaon banana’s skin that then leads to rot, it alsosignificantlyslows down the respiration in the first place. So bananas won’t drive you bananas."
