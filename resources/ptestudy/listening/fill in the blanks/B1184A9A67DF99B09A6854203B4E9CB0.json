    "text": "The London Olympics are about to begin, and  spectators will again be riveted by feats that would have been impossible when the modern Olympics began in 1896. Jaw-dropping records are attainable in part because of advances in materials science. New materials have led to equipment like super light and strong vaulting poles, and bathing  suits  that improve the flow of bodies in water. Such developments are detailed in a series of articles in the journal Nature Materials. The scientists say other advances are afoot that build sensors into athletes’ clothing for, for instance, measuring performance in training. Or protective gear that repairs itself when damaged. And advances in materials science can help Olympians internally as well. Elite  athletes may tear cartilage or break bones. But cartilage doesn’t have enough blood and cells to mend well, and sometimes bones just can’t naturally bridge the break. So scientists are homing in on the best combinationsof bio-compatible materials, along with growth factors and other compounds, as well as implanted cells and proteins, to help mend what have been until now nearly intractable injuries. So that world-class athletes can push the limits of sports and science."
