    "text": "50% of the world’s population is Vitamin – D deficient and we believe that it has serious health consequences for both children and adults alike. Major cause is lack of sun exposure humans have always depend on the Sun for their vitamin D requirement and it’s over the past forty years that it’s been suggested that you should never be exposed to direct sunlight that is one of the major causes of the vitamin D deficiency pandemic. Again, everybody thinks about vitamin D preventing rickets in children. We don’t see rickets any longer so people are not thinking about vitamin D. It’s incomprehensible to physicians as to how vitamin D could reduce risks of heart attack by fifty percent, reduce risk of common cancers like colon, prostate, breast by as much as fifty percent reduce risk of infectious diseases including influenza by as much as 90%, reducing risk of type I diabetes 78%, if a child is to get adequate vitamin D during the first year of life reduced risk of type II diabetes."
