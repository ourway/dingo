    "text": "When we look at a colour photograph … we have moved … away from … the object’s instrinsic reality, imposing several extra levels of interpretation. The particular chemical composition of the photographic process usd is one level; the colour film (or digital camera) itself automatically reacts to and records colour in the way it has been chemically or electronically profied, or programmed, to do. Then there is the subjectivity of the colour awareness – vision and creativity of the photographer, they eye behind the camera. Photographers have to experiment with what is available and discern a way of representing colour that suits their particular visual aethetic. Then the viewer imposes yet another level of interpretation, bringing his or her own colour appreciation to the existing photographs. If phtographs are printed, copied, scanned, viewed on a screen or reproduced on the pages of a book as here, then we are several generations and several futuerh levels of interpretation away from that original colour reflecting object. Is it any wonder that colour photography is maddeningly difficult to describe accuratly – and that reactions to ti are so diverse – given its wonderful subjective variations?"
