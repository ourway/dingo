    "text": "Learning is a process by which behavior or knowledge changes as a result of experience. Learning from experience plays a major role  in  enabling us to do many things that we clearly were not born to do, from the simplest tasks, such as flipping a light switch, to the more complex, such as playing a musical instrument. To many people, the term “learning” signifies the  activities  that students do reading, listening, and taking tests in order to acquire new information. This process, which is known as cognitive learning, is just  one  type of learning.  however , Another way that we learn is by associative learning, which is the focus of this module. You probably  associate  certain holidays with specific sights, sounds, and smells, or foods with specific flavors and textures. We are not the only  species  with this skill even the simplest animals such as the earthworm can learn by association."
