    "text": "Deciding to go to business school is perhaps the simplest part of what can be a complicated process. With nearly 600 accredited MBA programs on  offer  around the world, the choice of where to study can be overwhelming. Here we explain how to  choose  the right school and course for you and unravel the application and funding process. “Probably the  majority  of people applying to business school are at a point in their careers where they know they want to shake things up, but they don’t know exactly what they  want  to do with their professional lives,” says Stacy Blackman, an MBA admissions consultant based in Los Angeles. “If that’s the case with you, look at other criteria : culture, teaching method, location, and then pick a place that’s a good fit for you with a strong general management program. Super-defined career goals don’t have to be a part of this process.”"
