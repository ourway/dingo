    "text": "Hi everybody. This weekend, we’lldedicate the newest American icon on our National Mall – the National Museum of African American History and Culture. It’s a beautiful building, five stories high and some 70 feet below the ground, situated  just across the street from the Washington Monument. And this museum tells a story of America that hasn’t always taken a front seat in our national narrative . As a people, we’ve rightfully passed on the tales of the giantswho built this country. But too often, willful or not, we’ve chosen to glossover or ignore entirely the experience of millions upon millions of others. But this museum chooses to tell a fuller story. It’s doesn’t gauze up some bygone era or avoid uncomfortable truths. Rather, it embraces the patrioticrecognition that America is a constant work in progress; that each successive generation can look upon our imperfections and decide that it is within our collective power to align this nation with the high ideals of our founding."
