    "text": "The soothsayer’s warning to Julius Caesar, “Beware the Ides of March”, has forever imbued that date with a sense of foreboding. But in Roman times theexpression “Ides of March” did not necessarily evoke a dark mood – it was simply the standard way of saying “March 15.” Surely such a fanciful expression must signify something more than merely another day of the year? Not so. Even in Shakespeare’s time, sixteen centuries later,audiencesattending his play “Julius Caesar” wouldn’t have blinked twice hearing the date called the Ides."
