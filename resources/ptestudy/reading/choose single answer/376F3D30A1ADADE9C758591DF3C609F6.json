    "text": "It is generally believed that the Second World War began on September 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland by Germany. Some historians link it to the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on July 7, 1937. According to AJP Taylor, two wars were fought simultaneously; the Sino-Japanese War in East Asia and a Second European War in Europe and her colonies. These two wars merged in 1941 resulting in a single global armed conflict that continued till 1945. There is not a single universally agreed upon date of the end of the Second World War either. It is believed that the conflict ended with the armistice of August 14, 1945, popularly known as the Victory over Japan Day (VJ Day), a few days before the formal surrender of Japan on September 2, 1945. According to some European Historians, it ended as early as on May 8, 1945, known as the Victory in Europe Day (VE Day)."
