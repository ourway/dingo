    "text": "When I was in British Columbia last July working at the department’s archaeological dig, I saw the weirdest rainbow. At first I couldn’t believe my eyes because the bands of color I saw weren’t in a single half circle arc across the sky. Instead, I saw a full circle of rainbow hues hanging in the sky just above the sea. Inside the circle there was a big white disc and above the circle there was another round band of colors forming a halo. There were curved legs of multicolored light coming off the sides of the circles. It was an incredible sight. I ran back to our main camp and tried to get our cook to come with me to see my fantastic find before it disappeared. He just laughed at my excited story and told me that what I saw was noting special, just some “sundogs.” He said I’d be sure to see many more before I left. And sure enough, I did. When I got back from the dig, I asked Professor Clark about the “sundogs,” and she’s going to tell us more about them."
