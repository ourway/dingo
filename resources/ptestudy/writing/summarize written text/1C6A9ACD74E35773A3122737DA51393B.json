Coffee experience Whereas the fundamental essence of coffee experience emphasizes the significance of coffee’s effects on human health, the corresponding impacts of moderate coffee drinking such as adult consumers and major health outcomes are acknowledged, and observational data could be inferred evidently from further scientific research, which the potential implications of the risk-benefit balance, being mildly beneficial as well as coffee’s active ingredients are presumed.

    "text": "Coffee is enjoyed by millions of people every day and the “coffee experience” has become a staple of our modern life and culture. This is according to the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT), an international nonproﬁt scientiﬁc society of professionals engaged in food science, food technology, and related areas in academia, government and industry that is based in the US.  While the current body of research related to the effects of coffee consumption on human health has been contradictory, a study in the in the June issue of the journal Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety, which is published by IFT, found that the potential beneﬁts of moderate coffee drinking outweigh the risks in adult consumers for the majority of major health outcomes considered.  Researchers at Ulster University in the UK systematically reviewed 1,277 studies from 1970 to date on coffee’s effect on human health and found the general scientiﬁc consensus is that regular, moderate coffee drinking (deﬁned as three to four cups per day) essentially has a neutral effect on health, or can be mildly beneﬁcial. The authors noted causality of risks and beneﬁts cannot be established for either with the research currently available as they are largely based on observational data. Further research is needed to quantify the risk-beneﬁt balance for coffee consumption, as well as identify which of coffee’s many active ingredients, or indeed the combination of such, that could be inducing these health beneﬁts."
