    "text": "From a childâ€™s point of view, what is the purpose of TV advertising? Is advertising on TV done to give actors the opportunity to take a rest  or practice their lines? Or is it done to make people buy things? Furthermore, is the main difference between programs and commercials that commercials are for real whereas programs are not, or that programs are for kids and commercial for adults? As has been shown several times in the literature, some children are able to  distinguish between programs and commercials and are aware of the internet of TV advertising,  whereas  others are not."
