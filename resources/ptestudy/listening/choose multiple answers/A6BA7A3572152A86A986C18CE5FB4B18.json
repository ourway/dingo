    "text": "We’re going to go on a dive to the deep sea, and anyone that’s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down, it’s a perfectly positively pitch-black world. And we used to see the most strange animals out the window that you couldn’t describe: these alternating lights — a world of bio-luminescence, like fireflies. Dr. Elvis Walter — she’s now at the Indian Ocean Research Organization , she was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these unbelievable animals, and that’s what you’re seeing here on the screen. That’s all bio-luminescence. Like I said: just like fireflies. There’s a flying turkey under a tree. I’m a geologist by training. But I love that. And you see, some of the bio-luminescence they use to avoid being eaten, some they use to attract prey, but all of it, from an artistic point of view, is just positively amazing."
