    "text": "Hello. It’s Megan this week I’m going to talk about the difference between translators and interpreters. It’s a common misconception that translators and interpreters di the same thing. So I just like to highlight a few similarities and differences between the two… firstly translation refers to written communication whereas interpreting refers to verbal communication. So for example a translator will not attend a court hearing to verbally translate between the parties involved but would translate the written evidence used in the case. Secondly both jobs require different skills and translate to require the ability to write well and comprehensively into a target language. This means that they need to have an excellent command of their native language. For example although I can speak French to a good standard I cannot translate from English to French. Although I could translate from French into English. Which means I’m only halfway there to being an international player. An interpreter needs to be able to speak both languages proficiently. Thirdly the qualifications and experience required to become either a professional translator or interpreter do differ. Both roles acquire years of training the resulting qualification. But what they can learn on the training will be completely different. So just to be clear translators will translate written texts and interpreters will translate a verbal communication."
