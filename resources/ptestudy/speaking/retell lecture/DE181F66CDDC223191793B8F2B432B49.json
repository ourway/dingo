So let’s take a look okay, what we found is a very simple and direct way of measuring a competence that seems to make an important life difference a researcher tells these preschoolers that she’s going to leave the room if they wait for her to come back without eating the marshmallows. They’ll get two marshmallows or they can ring the bell and she’ll come back right away but then they only get one marshmallow. I would baby though you won’t ring the bell. Okay, looking at children over time. Dr. Michelle has found that being able to wait longer at four has some pretty powerful implications and what are those powerful implications is that that later in life. They’re more discipline and have more self-control is that pretty much it. Well, they are more likely to achieve their life goals. They have better relationships. They did better on their SI is crazy all because they waited 15 minutes for don’t wash me, and I think it is crazy. I probably would have eaten all three but yeah me too. But um you know actually yes, the ability to be able to pursue your goals in this case it was stabbed two marshmallows versus one and not going automatic and just grabbed the marshmallow is a very important skill, but I think a main point in mind in the making is that these skills can be caught cut if you’ re 14 or 40 or four it’s not ever too late and any child can learn the many adult can teach them and it’s never too late."
