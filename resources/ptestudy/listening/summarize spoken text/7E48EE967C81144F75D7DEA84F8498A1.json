    "text": "People who have been talking about symbolic representation of computers long before they were invented. Human tells the computer what to do and how to do. Computers can operate. Given the meaning of certain words. A human brain can be a simple processor. At the same time, a computer relies on analyzing messages into diets, which is similar to a human brain.
