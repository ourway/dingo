    "text": "This is the timeline of the Big Bang, The timeline of the universe. Now, we know that it began around 13.7 billion years ago. Back then. In the Big Bang.  And we know that when it began it was really a formless unimaginably hot bowl of not even matter. In fact, we think that all the forces of nature were merged together. There were no particles as we know them today. But as the universe continued to cool and expand then we think that the particles that we are made of and the forces that we’re familiar with today crystallized out in one of the most important moments with something got a fancy name called electroweak symmetry breaking is the point when mass entered the universe for the first time when things got substance for the first time.  It’s just about that they’re about a billionth of a second after the big bang and we’re investigating that at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva. We then know that the universe continued to cool and expand after around about a second. Then the familiar particles that make up the atomic nuclei of stars and planets and as the protons and neutrons formed in the universe. We know after about three minutes. So somewhere, around there, there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. The first two the simplest chemical elements the universe then continued to expand and cool. And after about 350 to 400 thousand years the universe was cold enough and diffused enough."
