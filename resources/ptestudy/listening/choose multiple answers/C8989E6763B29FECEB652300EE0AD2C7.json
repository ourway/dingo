    "text": "There are two main reasons why parents decide to educate their children at home: either they dislike schools on principle, however odd those principles might be, or they don’t believe their local schools provide an adequate education or the right sort of education for their children. If someone decides to teach their child at home – either by themselves or by employing a teacher – they have to convince their local education authority (LEA) that the teaching provided is satisfactory. Schedules, lesson plans and book lists must be shown, and it must also be demonstrated that the child is in fact learning and that they have adequate opportunities for physical education and meeting other children. Furthermore, while there is no formal assessment, officers from the LEA will come and inspect what is being done and look at the child’s exercise books. If they are not satisfied, they may make out a school attendance order."
