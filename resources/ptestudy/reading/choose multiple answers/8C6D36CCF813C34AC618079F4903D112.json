    "text": "According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, during the last half of the 20th century, the service sector became the largest and fastest-growing part of the U.S. economy. During the first half of the century, the service sector represented about 60 percent of the economy, but by the end of the 20th century, it represented about 80 percent. This has been a significant shift and an ongoing transition from an agrarian economy to manufacturing, and, ultimately, to the service economy that we see today.The shift from manufacturing to service-related production has left a significant impact on jobs. Dixie Sommers believed, four trends will be prevalent through year 2019. The trends include increase in aging population, a paradigm shift of employment from manufacturing to service-related industries, slower labor force growth and strong labor productivity growth. Sommers predicts the economy will generate 14 million new jobs, besides 30 million job openings that will come about due to retirements."
