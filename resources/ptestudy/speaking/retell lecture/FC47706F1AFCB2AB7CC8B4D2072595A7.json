    "text": "The Right Honorable Sir Winston Leonard Spencer–Churchill, KGOM, CH, FRS, PC(November 30, 1874 – January 24, 1965) was a British statesman, best known as prime minister of the United Kingdom during the Second World War. At various times a soldier, journalist, author, and politician, Churchill is generally regarded as one of the most important leaders in British and world history. Considered reactionary on some issues, such as granting independence to Britain’scolonies and at times regarded as a self-promoter who changed political parties tofurther his career, it was his wartime leadership that earned him iconic status. Someof his peacetime decisions, such as restoring the Gold Standard in 1924, were disastrous as was his World War I decision to land troops on the Dardanelles. However, during 1940, when Britain alone opposed Hitler’s Nazi Germany in the freeworld, his stirring speeches inspired, motivated, and uplifted a whole people duringtheir darkest hour. Churchill saw himself as a champion of democracy against tyranny, and was profoundly aware of his own role and destiny."
