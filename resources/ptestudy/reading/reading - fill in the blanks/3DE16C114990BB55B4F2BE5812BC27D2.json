    "text": "The supply of a thing, in the phrase “supply and demand,” is the amount that will be offered for sale at each of a  series  of prices; the demand is the amount that will be bought at each of a series of prices. The principle that value depends on supply and demand means that in the case of nearly every commodity, more will be bought if the price is lowered, less will be bought if the price is  raised . Therefore sellers, if they wish to  induce  buyers to take more of a commodity than they are already doing, must  reduce  its price; if they raise its price, they will sell less. If there is a general falling off if in demand — due, say, to trade depression — sellers will  either  have to reduce prices or put less on the  market ; they will not be able to sell the same amount at the same price. Similarly with supply. At a certain price a certain  amount  will be offered for sale, at a higher price more will be offered, at a lower price less. If consumers want more, they must offer a higher price; if they want less, they will probably be able to force prices down. That is the first  result  of a change in demand or supply."
