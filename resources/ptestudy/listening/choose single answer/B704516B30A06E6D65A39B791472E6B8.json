    "text": "Hello may I help you? yes, I hope so. My name is Harry Burke I got a message from someone in this office saying I still needed to pay a lab fee. Let me check Harry Burke. Oh yes, the computer shows that you haven’t paid the lab fee for your biology class. You’ll need to do this before you can attend your lab section. I didn’t know there was a lab fee. I don’t remember seeing it on my bill. did you register after September 15th. I think so. The fee probably didn’t show up on your bill because you registered late. I’m afraid you’ll have to pay to the cashier’s office. Okay I better take care of it right away. Thanks for letting me know."
