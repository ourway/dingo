    "question": "Which of the following is true about the writer’s perception of ethnicity?"

    "text": "Ethnic cultures are some of the richest and most interesting in the world. The forms of culture – oral narrative, drama, song, music, visual image, and so on – are universal, but the specific content and the particular way the universal form is realised in any one situation, place, or time is high varied and differentiated. And many of those differentiations can be attributed to the fact that people cluster together in communities often for reason of ethnic affiliation and identity.Ethnicity is both a physical fact and a cultural creation. An ethnicity comes into being when a group of people intermarry and form a large extended family that lasts usually for centuries, if not millennia. An ethnicity in this sense is a group that shares certain genetic traits, and that sharing lasts so long as the pattern of intermarriage lasts. Ethnicity usually manifests itself as physical differences such as eye shape or skin colour. And it is doubtful it is more than that. Conservative racist thinkers believe external traits signify internal mental differences. In this way of thinking, groups like Asians are more industrious “by nature.” Africans, in contrast, lack initiative for the same inevitable genetic reason. Liberal thinkers respond by noting that were this account of the world true, all Africans would be lacking in initiative and all Asians would be industrious. But that is not the case."
