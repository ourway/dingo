    "text": "Historically, reasons for the migration of Asians to the United States were similar in some ways to those for the Atlantic migration of Europeans â€” to escape from poverty and civil war and to find employment opportunity and freedom. Chinese laborers were recruited to build the transcontinental railroad in the mid-19th century and providedomestic services in cities such as San Francisco. They were followed by the Japanese and Filipinos in the early 20th century who labored in Hawaiian plantations  , California farms, and Alaskan canneries. Of these early Asian Americans, only the Japanese were allowed to immigrate as families at the insistence of the Japanese government. For these early generations, Asians in America were largely bachelorcommunities of temporary sojourners  , with male to female ratios as high as 10-to-1. Asian-American children in those early years were rare. Since 1970, the  demography of this of this population has changed tremendously. In 2002, Asian Americans were slightly more than 4 percent of the U. S. population. The growth of the Asian-American population since 1970 is due in great part to the  elimination of exclusionary immigration policies that existed before 1965, implementation of new refugee statutes directly flowing from the Vietnam War, and the rise of second and subsequent U.S. -born generations. In 1970, there were 1.5 million Asian Americans. This amounts to an eightfold to ninefold increase in little more than 30 years."
