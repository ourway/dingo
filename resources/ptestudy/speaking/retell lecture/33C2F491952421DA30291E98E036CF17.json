And this is the most widely and well-recognized in relation to climate change, CO2 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions. But I want to argue the certain dangers in the way that has been presented as the central question that we have to address. Because it is interlocked with a number of other crises that is most noticeably as the crisis in access to fresh water, crisis in access to food, biodiversity loss on a huge scale, and associated problems of human in equality not just in a common world, but actually in the kinds of environmental resources, and pleasures that I can enjoy. So all those together, have to be looked at an interconnected set of really deep profound crisis."
