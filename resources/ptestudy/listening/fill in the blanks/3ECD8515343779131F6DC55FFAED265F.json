    "text": "When the time comes, its peers should follow suit. Of these, the European Central Bank faces the trickiest challenge  , because it has acted as, in effect, the backstop to euro-zone bond markets, a mechanism  that otherwise the currency bloc still lacks. But the main safety valve lies elsewhere, with banks and investors. Bitter experience has shown that debt-funded assets can magnifylosses, causing financial crises. For this reason banks must be able to withstand any reversal of today’s high asset prices and low defaults. That means raising bank capital in places where it is too low, especially the euro zone, and not backsliding on strenuous “stress tests” as America’s Treasury proposes. In the end, however, there may be no escape for investors from the low future returns and even losses that high asset prices imply. They and regulators should take a leaf out of “The  intelligent Investor”, and make sure that they have a margin of safety."
