    "text": "Thermodynamics all right, Let’s start. thermodynamics is the science of the flow of heat. The thermo is heat and dynamics is the motion of heat Thermodynamics is developed largely, beginning in the 1800 at the time of the Industrial Revolution. Timing of steel, the beginning of generating power by burning fossil fuels. So anyway, thermal dynamics based on the same period as getting fossil fuels out of the ground, it’s universal. Turns out everything around us moves energy around and one where the other if your biological system your burning calories, burning ATP, creating heat, Warm-blooded animals, you need energy to move your arms around, move around, mechanical systems. Obviously, cars, boats, etc. and even astrophysics. When you talk about stars black hole etc., you’re moving energy around, you’re moving heat around .and you changing matter through thermodynamics. and the concepts of thermodynamics have even been applied to economics. systems of equilibrium like the companies like Enron. completely out of equilibrium, crash and burn. and apply thermodynamics or non-equilibrium thermodynamics to economics."
