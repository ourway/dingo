    "text": "BARRIE FINNIN, a professor at Monash University’s college of pharmacy in Melbourne, and PhD student Anita Schneider,recentlytested a new wrinkle cure. Twice daily, 20 male and female volunteers applied a liquid containing Myoxinol, a patentedextractof okra (Hibiscus esculentus) seed, to one side of theirfaces . On the other side, they applied a similarliquidwithout Myoxinol. Every week for a month their wrinkles were tested by self-assessment, photography and the size of depressions made in silicon moulds. The results were impressive. After a month thedepthand number of wrinkles on the Myoxinol-treated side were reduced by approximately 27 per cent.  But Finnin’s research, commissioned by a cosmetics company, is unlikely to be published in a scientific journal. It’s hard to even find studies that show the active ingredients in cosmetics penetrate the skin, let alone more comprehensive research on their effects. Even when rigorousstudies are commissioned, companies usually control whether the work is published in the traditional scientific literature."
