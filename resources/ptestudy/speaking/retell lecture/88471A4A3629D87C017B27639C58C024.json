In fact it’s second only to CO 2 in terms of warming so it’s actually ahead of methane, which you hear a lot about. The interesting thing about soot and aerosols’ impact on climate is that their lifetimes are so much shorter . So if we can reduce the soot we can make changes within months versus tens of years. It’s not to say we should ignore the CO 2 and the greenhouse gases but it could buy us some time while we actually do the right strategies to reduce the greenhouse gases."
