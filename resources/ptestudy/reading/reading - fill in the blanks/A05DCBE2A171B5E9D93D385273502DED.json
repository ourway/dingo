    "text": "What is the significance of instinct in business? Does a reliable gut feeling separate winners from losers? And is it the most valuable emotional tool any entrepreneur can possess? My observations of successful company owners lead me to believe that a highly analytical attitude can be a drawback. At critical junctures in commercial life, risk-taking is more an  act of faith than a carefully balanced choice. Frequently, such moments require  decisiveness and absolute conviction above all else. There is simply no time to wait for all the facts, or room for doubt A computer program cannot tell you how to invent and launch a new  product. That journey involves too many unknowns, too much luck — and too much sheer intuition, rather than the infallible  logic that machines deliver so well. As Chekhov said : “An artist’s flair is sometimes worth a scientist’s brains” —entrepreneurs need right-brain thinking. When I have been considering whether to buy a company and what price to offer, I have been  blinded too often by reams of due diligence from the accountants and lawyers_ Usually it pays to stand back from such mountains of grey data and weigh up the really important issues — and decide how you feel about the opportunity_"
