    "text": "There are many different ways to help other people. Perhaps the most common of these involves giving others practicalhelp. In our society, there are many individuals who spontaneously help others in this way. Additionally, there are others who belong to organizations which have been set up to provide help to specific groups, such as the elderly, the disabled, and those with serious physical ormentalhealth problems. Most importantly, there are manyoccupations, such as nursing, occupational therapy and social work, which involve professionals who are trained to provide or organize practical help for others. Whilehelping other people in a practical way, many volunteer and professional helpers also make use of some counselling. These skills can be very useful in enabling people to feel better as described in this book and our book, Counselling Skills in Everyday Life. However, it needs to berecognizedthat just being able to make use of some counselling skills does not qualify a person as counsellor."
