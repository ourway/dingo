    "answer": "53. Orbital Debris Whereas the fundamental essence of orbital debris emphasizes the significance of smashing a spacecraft, the corresponding impacts of a chain reaction such as a cascade of collisions and a critical mass are acknowledged, and spreading chaos could be inferred evidently from the critical spatial density, which the potential implications of an inevitable chain reaction as well as a list of detectable objects are presumed.

    "text": "For decades, space experts have worried that a speeding bit of orbital debris might one day smash a large spacecraft in to hundreds of pieces and start a chain reaction, a slow cascade of collisions that would expand for centuries, spreading chaos through the heavens. In the last decade or so, as scientists came to agree that the number of objects in orbit had surpassed a critical mass or, in their terms, the critical spatial density, the point at which a chain reaction becomes inevitable they grew more anxious.  Early this year, after a half-century of growth, the federal list of detectable objects (four inches wide or larger) reached10,000, including dead satellites, spent rocket stages, a camera, a hand tool and junkyards of whirling debris left over from chance explosions and destructive tests. So our billion dollar of satellites are at risk."
