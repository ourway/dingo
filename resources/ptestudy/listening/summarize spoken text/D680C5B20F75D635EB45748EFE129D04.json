Well, there is relationship between food and income in Africa. According to a recent research, most residents in Africa suffer from poverty and the main livelihood is wildlife, especially fish from the river. Fish is the major source of food and protein. Many Africans suffer from protein deficiency. So, it is important for Africa that fish is the major source of their income since fish industry can attract tourists around the world which can effectively facilitate the economic development. Fish will become the top one source of income in Africa and mind you even the income for foreign economies. This is why income is closely associated with food."
