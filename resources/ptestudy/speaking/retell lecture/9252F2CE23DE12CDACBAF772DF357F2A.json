    "text": "Network of underground tunnels that belong to the world’s largest particle accelerator is called The Large Hadron Collider .in this machine take some of the smallest particles known to man and collides them at speeds of 99.9999% the speed of light. to understand how the LHC works you can break it down in the three components that like it’s body, brain and heart. The body is the underground tunnels that form a giant circle, 17 miles around. Physicists actually ride bikes to get to different parts of the machine inside these tunnels is an environment so empty. It’s similar to what you’d find in the vacuum of outer space and that’s just the way physicists like it because they needed to be completely empty so they know exactly what they’re looking at when they start smashing particles together and the most energetic game of bumper cars imaginable. When the particles collide the extreme energy produced in the event creates entirely new and different particles and because these particles are too tiny to see with the naked eye, the LHC has four gigantic detectors through the brains of the outfit. Each detector weighs tens of millions of pounds is comparable in size to the main hall in the …. by far the most complex structure of the LHC. these are what businesses use to sit through the messy leftovers after a collision to spot special new particle. but that detector would have nothing to sit through if it weren’t for the LHC’s heart, which is the critical piece of technology that pumps the particles through the tunnels at such incredible speeds. Particles are moving so fast that they complete 11,000 laps around the 17 mile loop every second when the machine is running. The heart is a series of more than 1000 super chilled magnets that are colder than outer space itself, making the LHC the largest cryogenic system in the world."
