    "text": "Far too many people, hmmm….often say things like animals do this but we don’t, or else this animal does this and that animal does this, but the humans don’t do things like that. Those statements have some hidden assumption that we are not animals. When we say animals do this animals do that, we often assume that we’re not animals. If we are not animals, what are we? Are we plants or trees or flowers? No, we are not. Then okay, we are not plants, are we microorganisms, really tiny microscopic things? No, we are not. Then the natural conclusion must be we are not living things. That’s not true. Yes, we are animals and I see animals in us and I see humans in animals. So, I’m going to talk about the animal behavior and human nature. In order to understand human nature, we can look into animals’ eyes and animal behavior and find something about what made us who we are."
