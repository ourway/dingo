And we try to answer some very old questions about how does motivation and emotion work. I’m going to describe a scenario first and some of you may be familiar with it. This was developed by Pavlov over a century ago. And in this scenario the dog presented with the sound, the dog waits, and then receives food powder and this happens repeatedly. Interesting things start to happen here in the middle of the experiment. Pavlov’s studied salivation in dogs. The salivation will automatically occur once the dog hears the sound. But other things happened here, too. You have a dog move around here more, all kinds of things are going on here. What we were trying to capture was the experiment I’m going on to describe today, and that is what is going on in the brain to generate that state which we called it competitive state . But you can also think about state in terms of how the dog feel, how you feel about eating lunch today."
