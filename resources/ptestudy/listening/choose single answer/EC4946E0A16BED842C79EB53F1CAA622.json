    "text": "The nature-nurture debate is still going on. It is not a question oftaking sides because we know that both play an important part in what makes us who we are. It is more a question of emphasis – which of them has the greatest influence.On the nature side, we have what we get from our genes, our inherited traits – eye color and other physical traits, for example, but also, some believe, non-physical ones, suchas temperament. For example, you might be quick to anger, or havea nervous temperament, and this even extends to sense of humor. On the nurture side, there is what we get from our environment and our upbringing, what we learn.Research inlo the human genome has recently made it clear thatboth sides are partly right. Nature gives us inborn abilities and traits while nurture takes these genetic tendencies and shapes them as we grow and learn and mature. This is an important point as it means, contrary to the belief of some, that we are not wholly determined by our genes. Scientists have known for years that eye and hair color are determined by specific genes, but some now claim that such traits as intelligence and personality are also encoded in our genes."
