This implies the acceptance of the principle that development strategies should not only be  attuned  adhered  stuck  attached  attuned to country circumstances, but also be prepared and implemented under the leadership of the governments of the countries themselves. The 2005 World Summit also acknowledged, in this regard, that all countries must recognize the need for developing countries to strike a deal  balance  policy  correlation  balance  between their national policy priorities and their international commitments."
