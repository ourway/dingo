    "text": "Map-making has a long and fascinating h istory – both before Ptolemy produced the first great map of the world and after, up to the beautiful simplicity of the London Underground map and the precisely-detailed Ordnance Survey maps, which cover almost every inch of the United Kingdom.Ancient map-makers used to drawin hills, valleys and rivers to give an idea of the topography, the shape of the land. It wasn’t until the late 16th century that contour lines were used – that is, lines that linked points of the land at the same height – but this was to show the relative depths and shallows of a river. The first time land contours were used was on a map of France, which took about forty years to complete, and was finished in 1783. The Ordnance Survey was set up in 1791 andtheir maps, as the name suggests, were originally made for military purposes, and the first one to be produced was of the county of Kent at a ratio of one inch to one mile."
