    "text": "The special theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in Spring of 1905 and the space have a perhaps 5 intense weeks of thought, where he rewrote our understanding of space and time. Newton had given us an understanding of space and time back in late 1600s which is very intuitive. It’s the way we all think about space and time. Here is a space, it’s just this environment where things happen and time is this relentless thing that ticks forward on our watches, our clocks. Taking us moment after moment, second after second into the future in a completely uniform, absolute and unchanging way. In special relativity, Einstein said that’s not right. He said space and time can change depending upon how you move. He showed that if you’re moving relative to somebody else, time for you slows down. And these kinds of revolutionary ideas are not simply esoteric, pen and paper type understandings of the universe."
