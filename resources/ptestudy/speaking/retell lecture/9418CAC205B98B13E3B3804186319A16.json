    "text": "One other keys to Apple is Apple’s incredibly collaborative company, and so you know how many committees we have in Apple? Zero. No committee. We are organized like a start-up. One person’s in charge of iPhone OS software, one person is in charge of Mac hardware. One person is in charge of iPhone hardware engineering, another person is in charge of worldwide marketing, another person’s in charge of operations. We’re organized like a startup. We’re the biggest startup on the planet and we all meet for three hours once a week and we talk about everything we’re doing the whole business and there’s tremendous teamwork at the top of the company which filters down to tremendous teamwork throughout the company. And teamwork is dependent on trusting the other folks to come through with their part without watching them all the time but trusting that they’re gonna come through with their parts and that’s what we do really well and we’re great at figuring out how to divide things up in these great teams that we have and all work on the same thing, touch basis frequently and bring it all together into a product. We do that really well and so what I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and solve problems to make new products to make new marketing programs whatever it is."
