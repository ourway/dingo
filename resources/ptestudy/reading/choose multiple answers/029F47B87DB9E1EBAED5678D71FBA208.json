    "text": "In the early days of artificial intelligence research,it was commonplace for the well-educated academics in the field to think that being “intelligent” meant being good at things that other well-educated academic researchers struggled at, like playing chess. We now know, however, that it is far harder to get robots to do things that come naturally to us (like identifying objects and picking them up) than it is to get them to prove logical theorems or find patterns in huge volumes of data – things we humans struggle at.Carl Frey and Michael Osborne at Oxford University estimate that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of being automated in the next 20 years. Machines may not do the jobs the same way as people. There is a difference between machines doing something cheaply and doing it well.Frey and Osborne focus on “engineering bottlenecks” in AI and robotics, and compare these stumbling points with the requirements of jobs in order to determine which are most and least likely to be vulnerable to automation. The biggest bottlenecks are perception and manipulation, creative intelligence, and social intelligence, all of which computers struggle mightily at. While the trend in recent decades has been towards a hollowing out of “middle-skill” jobs and as increase in low-paying service sector jobs and high-paying, highly educated jobs, Frey and Osborne expect the automation in the future will mainly substitute for “low-skill and low wage” jobs."
