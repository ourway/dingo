    "text": "A bonus of dendrochronology is that the width and substructure of each ring reflect the amount of rain and the season  at which the rain fell during that particular year. Thus, tree ring studies also allow one to reconstruct past climate; e.g., a series of wide rings means a wet period, and a series of narrow rings means  drought"
