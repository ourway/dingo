  {
    "text": "The paintings of Eugene Delacroix are as political, complex, tumultuous and vivid as the life of Lord Byron, who inspired some of Delacroix’s best works, such as Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi, the paintings boast an incredible mélange of the artistic traditions of prior masters and movements such as a preoccupation with terribilitas from Michelanelo; a fair for color from titian; and power, strength, and exuberance from Rubens all underlain by the harmony and balance of classical artists and tinted with the Baroque. Delacroix combined eclectic elements and infused them with his own genius, creating a unique expression of Romanticism, and in so doing, inspired yet another style, Symbolism."
