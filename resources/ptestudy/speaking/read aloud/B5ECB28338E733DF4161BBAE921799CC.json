Fifty students from the University of Sydney’s Faculty of Engineering spent five months cobbling together bits of plywood, foam and fiberglass to build the ManGo concept car. They developed the specifications and hand built the car. It’s a pretty radical design: a four-wheel drive with a motor in each wheel."
