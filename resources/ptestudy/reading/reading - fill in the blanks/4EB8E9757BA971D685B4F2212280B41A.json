    "text": "In these distant times the sun was seen to make its daily journeyacross the sky. At night the moon appeared. Every new night the moon waxed or waned a little and on a few nights it did not appear at all. At night the great dome of the heavens was dotted with tiny specks of light. They became known as the stars. It was thought that every star in the heavens had its own purpose and that the secrets of the universe could be discovered by making a study of them.  It was well know that there were wandering stars, they appeared in different nightly positions against their neighbors and they became known as planets. It took centuries, in fact it took millennia, for man to determine  the true nature of these wandering stars and to evolve a model of the world to accommodate them and to predict  their positions in the sky."
