    "text": "Spring wedding season has arrived, ushering in hefty costs for guests — and especially for members of the wedding party. But it can be hard for twenty somethings to fit  extra costs into scant budgets, especially if you have multiple weddings to attend. So be sure to determine what you are signing up for before committing to be part of the ceremony or a guest at a destination wedding — and look for ways to trim costs. If you are asked to be part of a ceremony, don’t  hesitate  to ask the bride and groom upfront for details including the event’s location and other functions they may expect you to attend. In return, be honest with them about your financial situation. Colleen Bayus, 24, attended four weddings last year, traveling from Washington to Boston, Pittsburgh and Philadelphia a total of seven times for dress fittings, bachelorette parties and the ceremonies. “It really added  up … I had to tell my friend in Boston that I didn’t have the money to attend her bachelorette party in Manhattan,” she says. If you know you can’t afford to fly to a destination wedding in the Caribbean plus a weekend bridal party in Miami, speak up from the beginning, says Susan RoAnne, a networking and etiquette expert in San Francisco. “It’s fair to say ‘I love you, but I don’t want to shortchange you if I can’t afford to participate in every aspect,'” she says."
