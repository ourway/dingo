    "text": "In 1943 what became known as the green revolution began with Mexico unable to feed this growing population shouted for help. Within a few years the Fourth and Rockefeller Foundations founded the international rice research institute in Asia and by 1962 a new strain of rice called IRAs was feeding people all over the world. IOH was the first really big modified crop to make a real impact on world hunger. In 1962 the technology did not yet exist to directly manipulate the genes of plants and so IRH was created by carefully crossing existing varieties. Selecting the best from each generation further modifying them and finally finding the best. Hereâ€™s the power of modified crops. IR8 with no fertilizer straight out of the box produce five times the yield of traditionalrice varieties in optimal conditions with nitrogen it produced 10 times the yield oftraditional varieties. By 1980 IR36 resisted pests and grew fast enough to allow two crops a year instead of just on doubling the yield and by 1990 using more advanced genetic manipulation techniques. IR72 was outperforming even IR36. The green revolution saw worldwide crop yields explode from 1960 through 2000."
