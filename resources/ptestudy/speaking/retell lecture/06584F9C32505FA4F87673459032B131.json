    "text": "I’m sure you realize that your research papers are due in six weeks . I’ve looked at your proposed topics and made comments about them. The most frequent problem was proposing too broad a topic. Remember, this is only a fifteen -page paper. As I return your topic papers, I’d like to look over the schedule which sketches out what we’ll do during the next two weeks. Today is Monday; by Friday, I want your preliminary outline. Please be sure to incorporate the suggestions I’ve made on your topics in your outlines. Next week I’ll have a conference with each of you. I’ve posted a schedule on my office door. Sign your name to indicate the time you’re available for an appointment. In the conference, we’ll discuss your preliminary outline. Then you can make the necessary revisions and hand in your final outline , which is due two weeks from today. Use the outline style in your textbook and remember it should be no more than two pages long. Be sure to begin with a thesis statement, that is, with a precise statement of the point you intend to prove and include a conclusion. Have you got all that? Your two-page preliminary outlines are due at the end of this week and the final outlines are due after your conferences . Follow the textbook style and include a thesis statement and a conclusion."
