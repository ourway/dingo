    "text": "For many people today, reading is no longer relaxation.To keep up their work they must read letters, reports, trade publications, interoffice communications, not to mention newspapers and magazines: a never-ending flood of words.In getting a job or advancing in one, the ability to read and comprehend .Qickly can mean the difference between success and failure.Yet the unfortunate fact is that most of us aregoodcuriouspoorurgent poor readers. Most of us develop poor reading habits at an early age, and never get over them. The main deficiency lies in the actual stuff of language itself-words.Taken individually, words havesomeA lotlittledulllittle meaning until they are strung together into phrased, sentences and paragraphs. FortunatelyIn factLogicallyUnfortunatelyUnfortunately , however, the untrained reader does not read groups of words.He laboriously reads one word at a time, often regressing to reread words or passages.Regression, the tendency to look back over what you have just read, is a common bad habit in reading.Another habit whichscalescutsslowsmeasuresslows down the speed of reading is vocalization—sounding each word either orally or mentally as some oneonehereader one reads.  To overcome these bad habits, some reading clinics use a device called an accelerator, which moves a bar (or curtain) down the page at a predetermined speed.The bar is set at a slightly faster rate than the reader finds comfortable, in order to“stretch”him.The accelerator forces the reader to read fast, enablingleadingmakingindicatingmaking word-by-word reading, regression and subvocalization, practically impossible. At first comprehension is sacrificed for speed.But when you learn to read ideas and concepts, you will not only read faster,but your comprehension will improve. Many people have foundouryourtheirsuch atheir reading skill drastically improved after some training.Take Charlce Au, a business manager, for instance, his reading rate was a reasonably good 172 words a minute before the training,now it is an excellent 1,378 words a minute.He is delighted that how he can get through a lot more reading material in a short period of time."
