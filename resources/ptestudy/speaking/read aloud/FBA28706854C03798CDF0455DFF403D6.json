    "text": "A university is not a business. More precisely, a not-for-profit college or university is significantly different than a for-profit business. A university has no owners; it is a public trust. Without owners it has no one to pay dividends to, and no one for whom it must maximize its profits. A business has a single overriding goal: the maximization of return for the owners. A university has a multiplicity of goals: to foster learning, to create knowledge, and to serve its community."
