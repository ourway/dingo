There were characters in a play in the 1920s called Rossum’s universal robots and their play was written by a Czech writer called Karel Capek and basically these robots. You know people tend to think of robots as kind of cute cuddly toys or you know Hollywood depictions kind of devoid of politics. But the first robots were actually created and imagined in a time of absolute political turmoil .You just had the first world war. You finished that had a devastating impact across Europe. And people kind of reflecting on what does it mean to be human what makes us human those kind of questions and this kind on context is what inspired Czech x to kind of write this play and interestingly these robots have been humans. They are actually in the play assembled on a production line a bit like the Ford manufacturing production line. So even though they are human they are assembled and these robots are designed to labor and manage their primary purpose in society."
