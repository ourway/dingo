Why is that unreasonable? It’s an extremely negative way of conceiving of needs, for one. I mean we’re all human beings, we’ve all got needs… It’s just something that seems to sort of underpin these ableist attitudes towards the sorts of lives that contribute to society and the sorts of lives that detract from society’s resources."
