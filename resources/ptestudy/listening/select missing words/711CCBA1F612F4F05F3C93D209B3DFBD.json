    "text": "How much the Earth’s climate will change in the future depends, among other things, on how quickly and to what extent the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases. If we take no action to limit future greenhouse gas emissions, it is estimated that there will be a rise in temperature of 0.2 to 0.3°C every ten years. This is a far greater rate of warming than anything that has occurred over the past ten thousand years. One set of predictions claims that some regions of the world will warm more quickly than others, and rainfall will also increase in some areas and decrease in others. These changes will affect the sea level, which could rise by 50cm over the next century. All this will affect humans through the effects it has on water resources,"
