    "text": "The Alpine Newt is native to much of central, continental Europe and  occurs  up the coasts of northeast France through to Holland but it does not  appear  to have been native to the British Isles. As its name  suggests  it can be found in montane habitats up to 2,500 meters in  altitude  but it can also be abundant in lowlands, and it will use a variety  of water-bodies including both shallow and deep ponds and slow flowing streams (Griffiths, 1995)."
