    "text": "Scientists preparing for NASA’s proposed Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter believe that Jupiter’s moons Europa may be a corrosive mixture of acid and peroxide . Thus, it may not be the ideal place for life to exist as was thought possibly to be the case. Virtually all the information we have about Europa comes from the spacecraft Galileo, which completed its mission to study Jupiter and its moons close up before NASA dramatically crashed it into Jupiter in 2003. Although the general perception of Europa is of a frozen crust of water ice harboring a salty subterranean ocean kilometers below, researchers studying the most recent measurements say light reflected from the moon’s icy surface bears the spectral fingerprints of hydrogen peroxide and strong acids. However they accept that it could just be a thin surface dusting and might not come from the ocean below."
