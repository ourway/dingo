    "text": "The universe we know it is actually really old. Do you know exactly how old is the universe? The universe is about 50 billion years old and it is discovered that the oldest star is about 30 billion years old, not older than the universe which is perfectly matched. Well, people thought it might expand it 10 to 20 billion years ago however according to the theory of big bang it actually happened 13 .7 billion years ago. The big bang theory is also known as the cosmological model is simply an amazing discovery. The expansion of the universe had really occurred 13.7 billion years ago which is can match the current prediction of the cosmological model. However, we still not sure how many years more and will expand in the future is really unknown to us."
