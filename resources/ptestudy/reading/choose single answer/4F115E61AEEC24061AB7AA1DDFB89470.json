    "text": "Excise taxes are governmental levies an specific goods produced and consumed inside a country. They differ from tariffs, which usually apply only to foreign-made goods, and from sales taxes, which typically apply to all commodities other than those specifically exempted. In their modern farm, excise taxes were first developed by Holland in the 17th century, and established by law in England in 1643. Introduced into the Dutch colonies in America, the system spread to other colonies. Such taxes were first used by the federal government in 1791 and aroused great apposition. They were repealed (1802) in Thomas Jeffersonâ€™s administration. During the War of 1812 comprehensive excise taxes were levied again but were repealed in 1817."
