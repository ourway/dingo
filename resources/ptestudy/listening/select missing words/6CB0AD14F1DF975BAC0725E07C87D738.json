    "text": "The Pyramids in Cairo are my favourite buildings in the whole world. I knew all about them when I was very young. They have always fascinated me. They really are one of the world’s wonders. People still don’t know how they were built. I think they are probably the greatest architectural achievement ever. Even the tallest buildings today are easy to build. The Pyramids were almost impossible to build, but they did it. Two things fascinate me about The Pyramids – their beautiful shape and their mystery. I love looking at photos of The Pyramids. When I visited Egypt, their beauty blew me away. And the great thing was I also felt their mystery. The Pyramids are full of hidden secrets, history and mysteries."
