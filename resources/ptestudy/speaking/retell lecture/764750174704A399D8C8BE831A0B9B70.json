    "text": "We actually have seen more than one of these black holes emerges and we’ve seen actually two about equally good although the one that we talked about you can see with your eyes. The second one is the one with the lighter black holes in it, they’re not so heavy, when the ringing is a lot longer and you can see it without all the fancy data analysis. Then there is a third source which we’ve already published, but now that we have seen that two of the other one and we also believe that could very well be black hole theory, so we have three sources, let’s call it three sources in three months. Now if we make design sensitivity, we have improved apparatus, by another factor of three. Now how does that translate into rate? It turns out if you look with a sensitivity three times better than we have, you can look three times deeper into the universe. That says the volume of the universe that you are looking at is three to the Q, so that’s about 27 or 30 around the universe. So instead seeing one a month of these black hole periods, we should see one of maybe one of every two days, one every day. That’s going to change the character of how we operate completely. At that moment launched into what I called the astronomy that’s associated gravitational wave astronomy. That’s going to be a big day."
