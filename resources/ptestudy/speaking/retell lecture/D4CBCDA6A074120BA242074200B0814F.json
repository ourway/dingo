Truth is suggest … is different than XX Rhetoric is the dressing, is the body ,right? Truth is the spirit, is the soul, is abstract. It doesn’t have a body. It’s not particular. If you wanna get somebody to the truth, you might have to use some kind of tricks. Right? Because most of people are not sound and can see the truth. That’s what we think. Most people are rambles. Really. Only the educated be erudite are actually capable of seeing the truth. If you wanna get the general mass there, you may have to do a little bit. So Aristotle that is rhetoric. Rhetoric is something that is used to influence people. Right? And it’s a kind of mentally promised a logic. Rhetoric is important because it can help us to understand truth and influence morons. Some people can understand truth, because they are rational. But most people don’t. If you want to make people get into truth, you have to use tricks because truth itself is abstract. We can use rhetoric to help people understand truth. Truth is the spirit, the soul and is abstract, but rhetoric is the body, which is fundamentally based on logic."
