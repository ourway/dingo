    "text": "Once an organization has its product to sell, it must then determine  the appropriate price to sell it at. Balancing many factors including supply-and-demand, cost, desired profit, competition, perceived value, and market behaviour sets the price. Ultimately, the final price is determined by what the market is willing to  exchange for the product. Pricing theory can be quite complex because so many  factors influence what the purchaser decides is a fair value."
