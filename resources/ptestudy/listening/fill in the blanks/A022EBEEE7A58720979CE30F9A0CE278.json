    "text": "There are more than 160 known species of chameleons. The maindistribution is in Africa and Madagascar, and other tropical regions, although some species are also found in parts of southern Europe and Asia. There are introduced populations n Hawaii and probably in California and Florida too. New species are still discovered quite frequently Dr. Andrew Marshall, a conservationist from York University, was surveying monkeys in Tanzania, when he stumbled across a twig snake in the Magombrea forest which, frightened, coughed up a chameleon and fled. Though a colleaguepersuaded him not to touch it because of the risk from venom, Marshall suspected it might be a new species."
