    "text": "So it seems that well despite the fact that more couples are childless and more people are working in the cities, the pull to the suburbs has continued. Over 50 percent of Americans … that’s about 158 million live in the suburbs now, while in 1990 that figure was around 48 percent. That’s actually a difference of 40 million. Rural areas, on the other hand, have not seen the same pattern at all. Populations have declined over the past 20 years and now only 16 percent of our nation lives there."
