    "question": "What is an important rationale for art therapy?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Art therapy can be defined as a form of psychotherapy which uses art as its main means of communication, Patients needn’t have any particular talent in art, since the art therapist is not concerned with making an assessment of what the patient produces. The principle aim of this kind of therapy is to facilitate the patient’s well-being in order to bring change and growth on a personal level through the use of art materials. Obviously, as always, the relationship between the therapist and the patient is important but art therapy differs from other psychological therapies because it’s a process between the patient, the therapist and the art. So, what we’ve found is. the expressive nature of this therapy is particularly successful with those who have difficulty expressing themselves verbally."
