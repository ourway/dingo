    "text": "Dr Matthews said demographic characteristics had a substantial impact on the choices people made about KiwiSaver  funds  and retirement savings more generally. When it came to fund selection, she found there were significant differences based on gender. Men are more likely to  invest  in aggressive and growth funds, while women are more likely to choose  conservative  funds. “Males are risk takers, whether it’s in their choice of car or their investment fund,” she says. “But when it comes to long-term savings, risk taking can  actually  be an advantage.”  On the other hand , both the youngest and oldest age groups were more likely to be invested in conservative funds.  While  this might be appropriate for the life-cycle stage of older investors, it might not be so appropriate for younger,  longer-term  investors."
