    "text": "Impressionism was an art movement of the 19th century, which began as a private association of Paris-based artists who exhibited publicly in 1874. The term impressionism originated from art critic Louis Leroy, who commented Monet’s painting ‘Impression: Soleil Levant’. Leroy said that it indeed was just an impression and that the work could not be considered finished. The Impressionists adopted this term and decided to use it for their ownbenefit  Early Impressionist painters were radicals in their time’ breaking many of the rules of picture making that had been set by earlier generations Up until the Impressionists’ history had been the accepted source  of subject matter for paintings."
