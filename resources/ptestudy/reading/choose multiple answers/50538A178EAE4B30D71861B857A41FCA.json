    "text": "Country music scholars generally overlook the role that African – Americans played in the formation of this genre. Typically, scholars trace the birth of country music to the recording sessions that record producer and talent scout Ralph Peer held in Bristol, Tennessee, in 1927. However, the origins of country music go back much further and owe a great deal to African – American musicians, some known and some anonymous and unheralded. The banjo, field hollers, and gospel music are examples of country genre staples that are rooted in the African – American experience. Moreover, some of the “stars” of country music learned their trade from African – American musicians. Rufus “Tee Tot” Payne, for instance, educated Hank Williams. In addition to jazz, gospel and the blues, country music now clearly needs to be included in the list of musical genres that have an African – American lineage."
