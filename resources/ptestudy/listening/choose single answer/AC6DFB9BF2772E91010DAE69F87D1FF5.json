    "question": "What does the instructor imply about composition?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Listen to an art instructor talk about composition. composition is the organization of shapes and forms into a whole and expressive whole. The elements of composition, line, shape, tone and color need to be well arranged need to be ordered. They need to be coherent, just like the words and phrases and sentences in a piece of writing. All paintings have a compositional element, successful paintings, sort of suggest the third dimension, the sense that the design goes beyond the picture frame. a pictures unity which includes the shapes tones and colors is linked to what the artist has to say. The artists message is strongest when itâ€™s clear. A composition is better if it says one thing strongly, than if it tries to say too many things. a crowded composition was sort of fussy and splintered and lacks unity. even a painting of a single object needs thoughtful composition. so the character of the object is present in every shape."
