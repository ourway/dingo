Mass General’s cafeteria food and beverage options were classifiedas least, somewhat or most healthful with red, yellow or green labels. Green is healthiest. Researchers then tracked some 4,600 employees. About six months after the changes were made, the purchases of “red” label food decreased by more than 15 percent, and “red”  beverages dropped by 39 percent. “Green” food and drink purchases increased, according to the study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
