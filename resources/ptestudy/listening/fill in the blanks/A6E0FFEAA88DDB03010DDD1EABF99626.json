    "text": "When at table, he was totally absorbed in the business of the moment; his looks seemed riveted to his plate; nor would he, unless when in very high company, say one word, or even pay the least attention to what was said by others, till he had satisfied his  appetite  , which was so fierce, and indulged  with such  intenseness , that while in the act of eating, the veins of his forehead swelled, and generally a strong perspiration  was visible. To those whose sensations were delicate, this could not but be disgusting; and it was doubtless not very suitable to the character of a philosopher, who should be distinguished by self-command. But it must be owned, that Johnson, though he could be rigidly ABSTEMIOUS, was not a TEMPERATE man either in eating or drinking. He could refrain, but he could not use moderately . He told me, that he had fasted two days without inconvenience, and that he had never been hungry."
