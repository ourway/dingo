It has emerged as one of today’s greatest instruments of progress and has gradually become a part of the vital  infrastructure  of global social, economic, cultural and political life. The Internet’s effect on our lives is pervasive  . Over the past decade, the use of email, the web and blogs have become part of the daily routine of more than a billion Internet users. Today the Internet access touch points have outgrown  the traditional PC based Internet browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox) to desktop applications, mobile phones and satellite navigational devices in vehicles and living rooms. More and more people are buying movie tickets, air tickets, travel pacakages, railway tickets and paying bills online  . Online gaming is projected to increase by 141% by 2011 in the Asia Pacific Region and mobile gaming to increase by 119% by a leading gaming industry. Very soon we will see the dawn of the video age when video will be used for buying, communicating, learning and socializing. Online chat and blogs are reducing the gap between private and public life of the present generation. Cyber cafes have taken over pubs and bars  for socializing in spite of the opposing forces of regional borders,copyright  , censorship, network blocking, etc."
