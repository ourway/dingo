    "text": "It’s been suggested that we get rid of the study of humanities altogether. Some say studying subjects like history, philosophy, politics, literature, anthropology, and so on, has no intrinsic value and why should we waste time and energy on courses of study that won’t lead directly to a cut and dried career. They say that what the world needs now is specialists, not generalists. Well, I have to say, I couldn’t disagree more. Of course we want to produce well-informed, literate, highly functioning citizens who make solid contributions to society. That’s an idea that still holds sway — but that’s not the reason that I believe studying the humanities is valuable. People who study a breadth of topics, and who have a diverse range of interests, are actually better problem solvers. This broad education means they can approach an issue"
