    "question": "Which of the following is not mentioned as being a type of genre fiction?"
  },
  {
    "text": "The division of literary works into genres – or texts thot deal witha particular subject, or a subject in a particular way – makes life easier for the person browsingin a bookshop. He or she can go directly to where their favorite kind of book is shelved, be it science fiction, gothic, romance, and so on. Many writers of genre fiction are immensely popular and successful, Stephen King and J. K. Rawling to name only two. But, for the most part, such writers aren’t depicting the world we live in and are writing fantasies. However, some genre writers, particularly writers of detective and police fiction, are unhappy about being categorizedin this way. Genre fiction, they say, has come to be seen as inferior to what is called mainstream or literary fiction. In other words, detective fiction isn’t taken seriously as literature, and yet crime novels do deal with the raw stuff of everyday life. They are, in fact, closer to the harsh reality of the modern worldthan most mainstream fiction.But, the critics say, while they do deal with the usual stuff of novels– character, emotion, psychology, social comment, and so on – it seldom goes very deep, and besides, most detective fiction, like certain mass-produced romantic novels – though not to anywhere near the same extent- follow a formula."
