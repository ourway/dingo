      "Epilepsy is a common and chronic disorder, mostly without a known cause, in which the brain shows abnormal activity. The treatment controls it but does not necessarily cure it.",
      "Epilepsy is quite common among children, though some adults are also affected. It usually goes off at its own, but in some cases may cause Alzheimer’s and stroke.",
      "Epilepsy is usually treated with medication, though it needs surgery in extreme cases. In seventy percent cases there is no known cause.",
      "Epilepsy may sometimes hint at other neurological problems like brain tumor, stroke or meningitis. So, it needs to be treated with care."
