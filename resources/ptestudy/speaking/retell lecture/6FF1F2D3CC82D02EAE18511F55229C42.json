    "text": "state. That means that our elected officials are being chosen by an increasingly tiny, often incredibly partisan slice of the electorate. Today 42% of Americans identify themselves as independents. Most states include independent voters from voting in the first round, the primaries. And in states that do allow them to vote in primaries, they are forced to temporarily join a party that they don’t believe in. A Top Two nonpartisan primary eliminates party control in favor of a single, nonpartisan primary open to all voters and all candidates. There is no longer a Democratic primary and a Republican primary, there is one primary open to all voters and all candidates. The top two vote getters, regardless of party, then move forward to the general election. With nonpartisan primaries everyone gets to vote. The winners are more accountable, because they have to speak to all the voters in order to get elected. Elections are more competitive. Legislators are encouraged to work across party lines and focus on issues we care about. Top Two nonpartisan primaries are now used in California, Washington and Nebraska at the state level. You’ve probably already voted using Top Two. Most municipal elections nationwide use this simple, nonpartisan system. Today, activists in all 50 states are working to bring this crucial system change to their state. The movement is growing. Join us and help us create a government that truly is by and for the people."
