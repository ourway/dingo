    "text": "Coffee can be considered one of nature’s greatest gifts. It gives mental and emotional  clarity  without harmful side effects, (like alcohol or tobacco), and it contains a wealth of nutrients. Yet, when most people drink coffee, they are not thinking that the beverage is  improving  their health. In fact, some may even feel a little guilty, since  they believe coffee isn’t good for you at all.  Well, here’s the truth of the matter. Coffee, like anything else, can cause problems if too much is  consumed . In the short-term, too much coffee will cause insomnia, nausea and hypertension. In the long-term, too much coffee will cause stomach problems, teeth staining, and high cholesterol.  As for the benefits, moderate consumption of coffee, (which means 1 to 4 cups a day), supplies your body with a wealth of antioxidants. These substances are  responsible  for eliminating free radicals. They are the chemical byproducts produced any time your body does something. A small number of them can help serve as a buffer against negative elements, but if they aren’t kept in check, they can cause health problems. Antioxidants  ensure  that this doesn’t happen.  The psychological effects of caffeine cannot be  ignored  either. Not only does caffeine make you more  alert , but it can actually affect your mood. If you were feeling  depressed  or overwhelmed, a nice cup of coffee could change your perspective. The stack of work that seemed  impossible  before isn’t even a problem now. In addition , caffeine helps stimulate creativity as it speeds up the body’s functioning. That’s why coffee is often  associated  with writers and other intellectual professions. Other drugs  tend  to make people dumber. Consider what happens when people get high off of crack or when they get drunk off of alcohol. They won’t be functional at all. But with coffee, an individual gets a creative boost while still helping their bodies.  In conclusion, don’t feel bad when you’re brewing your morning cup of coffee. Unlike  a can of soda or a shot of alcohol, coffee will make you feel wonderful while keeping you healthy. Just remember, you do have to consume the beverage  in moderation ."
