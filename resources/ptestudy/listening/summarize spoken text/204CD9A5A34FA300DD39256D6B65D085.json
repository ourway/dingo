    "text": "Today I want to talk about water, and the,the law that surrounds drinking water, to talk about its quality, talk about what your rights are to clean water, to also give you a sense of what key threats are to drinking water, what your exposure might be, and what we might do about it, both legally but also personally. Water is a critical component of our environment and our bodies, your body is close to 70% water. You can go for several weeks two to three on average without food, you can only go for about four minutes without air, and you can go for maybe four or five days without water before you die. So water is absolutely critical, and one of the key arguments I want to make today is that itâ€™s a largely neglected area of environmental law, given the rapid increase in our knowledge about chemical threats to water quality, and where those threats come from."
