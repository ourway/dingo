    "text": "Historically, tribes were granted federal recognition through treaties or by executive order. Since 1978 however, this has been replaced by a lengthy and stringent regulatory process which requires tribes applying for federal recognition to fulfil seven criteria, such as anthropological and historical evidence. One of the complications regarding federal recognition is the legal definition of “Indian”. Previously, racial criteria, tribal records and personal affidavits were used to classify American Indians. Since the 1970s, however, there has been a shift to the use of a political definition – requiring membership in a federally recognized tribe in order to qualify for benefits, such as loans and educational grants. This definition, however, excludes many individuals of Native American heritage who are not tribal members."
