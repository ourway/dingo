  },
  {
    "text": "People tend to think that any new technology or device is an act of genius; something that has required vision and insight to create and then develop into a marketable product. The fact is that innovations were often already ‘out there’ in the public domain in some form or another. They tend to evolve from notions that have been around for years but that had not，until that point, been suitably adapted. One expert calls this the ‘long nose’ approach to innovation, whereby new concepts come into the world slowly， gradually revealing all they have to offer."
