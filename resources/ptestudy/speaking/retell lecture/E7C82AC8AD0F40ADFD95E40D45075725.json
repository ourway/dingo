    "text": "The brand is the talent and let’s stick with that sports analogy, the answer is you can spend 450 million dollars in the stadium. But if over a ten-year period, the player talents no good, and there’re more losses than their wins, they are going to be a lot of more empty seats in their foyers, right? No matter how good the marketing is, no matter how beautiful the stadium is, the brand is the talent. Bennis and Biermann again “the leaders of Great Groups love talent and know where to find it. They revel, revel in the talent of others”. Only, only in the stupid world of business and government, do we promote the best accountant? Do they have the accounting department? The best salesman, do they have the sales department? The best trainer, do they have the training department? You know, do that in sports, right ? The definition of most of our coaches at professional level is they were second-rate or marginal players, were brilliant students in the game and people, that is they were good, what a good leader is doing? Leading, there was a guy when I was a kid, Yale university used to win NCAA swimming championships year after year after year. And I never heard the scene has proven, but sure it doesn’t surprise me. There was an interesting thing about their coach, he couldn’t swim, but he can sure motivate swimmers. And that’s the point, isn’t it? It’s the thing called leadership."
