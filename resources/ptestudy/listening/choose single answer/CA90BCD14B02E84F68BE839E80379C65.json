    "text": "Speech is a great blessing. It can also a great curse for while it helps us to make our intentions and desires known to fellow beings it can also make us utterly misunderstood if used carelessly. A slip of tongue, the unusual word or of an ambiguous word may create an enemy where we had hoped to win a friend. Different classes of people use different vocabularies and the ordinary speech of an educated man may strike an uneducated listener as showing pride, unwillingly we may choose to use a word which has a different meaning for our listeners from what it means to those of our class. Thus speech is not a gift to use lightly without thought but one which demands careful handling. Only a fool will express himself alike to all."
