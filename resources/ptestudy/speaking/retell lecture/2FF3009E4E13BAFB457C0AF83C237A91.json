These are groups of people you get together to find out about their opinions and attitudes. For example, to review a piece of work, or just basically provide some collective input to help you with whatever you are researching. First of all, how large should a focus group be? Well, I would say that an ideal number of participants is around 6 or 7. If it’s any bigger, what quite often happens is they break into side conversations, and the focus is lost. If it is any smaller , you may not get the range of views that you need to get a really good discussion . Secondly, it is important that you have a moderator for the group, who is able to facilitate and guide the discussions. The moderator must ensure that everyone participates and stop anyone dominating. And also, the moderator must make sure that the discussion don’t go off in the wrong direction. And thirdly, in order to help the group focus on what’s required, some basic materials should be used, particularly to kickstart the discussions. These may be in the form of pictures, photos, diagrams , graphs etc. and will help the group to understand the context of what needs to be discussed."
