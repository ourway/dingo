    "text": "So next Wednesday you’re all going to be doing your presentations. We’ll have to be very strict about timing. Fifteen minutes each – not a minute more. It might make sense to do a practice run·through at home but that’s up to you. I’m going to ask you to put an abstract of your presentation on our course website but I’dlike you to do that after you’ve given your talk. Come with your slides on a memory stick – that’s the most straightforward way of dealing with things, I think. Oh, and don’t forget to bring handouts for everyone. There won’t be time to do photocopying that morning. So, any questions!"
