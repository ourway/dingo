    "text": "I’m 43 years old and I will tens of thousands of dollars in student loans oh sure I knew the loans are piling up as I went through school but with one loan coming from here another from there I had no idea of the rock slide that was building 15 years later I still experience moments of sheer horror regarding my family’s financial situation my monthly student loan payment is more than triple my car payment okay so without my college degree I would not have been able to get my current job for that I’m grateful but at what cost my loans have been accruing at a rate of 10 percent and now they have burgeoned – well I’m an English major you do the math I don’t think they’ll ever get paid off we’re in debt way past our eyeballs and there’s no hope in sight I’m being kept in class a financial class of graduates whose only hope for attending college meant borrowing money from the government because of our mounting credit card debt and monthly payments that far exceed our family’s income my kids will also join the class of citizens who can’t rely on their parents for college support do I wish I’d chosen another educational route you bet perhaps trade school I thought that being a plumber might not be such a bad gig but if your job aspirations require a four-year degree take my advice and choose a college you can afford both during and after graduation take a realistic look at your anticipated income and factor in priorities that don’t carry a price like the spouse and children you might want to have someday I was overconfident that my student loan debt would pale in comparison to the lucrative writing career I’d enjoy after graduation now I’m paying for that decision in more ways than I’d ever imagined."
