    "text": "The domesticated silver fox is a form of melanocytic, domesticated red fox. In 1959 the Soviet Union set up the fox selective breeding project, aimed at artificially breeding tamer, more dog-like foxes for the fur trade. By selecting and breeding the tamest foxes over successive generations, soviet scientists eventually succeeded in breeding foxes of similar tameness to domestic dogs. These foxes retained many juvenile traits similar to today’s domestic dogs, and showed dog like behaviour such as whining, barking and submissiveness. However an unexpected side effect of the breeding program included patterned and patchy coats similar to various breeds of dog, thus making them unsuitable for the fur industry. Academically, this experiment has provided valuable insights into how wolves may have become domesticated during the Neolithic period to form today’s domestic dogs. Today, domesticated silver foxes are sold as exotic pets to in order to continue domestic fox research."
