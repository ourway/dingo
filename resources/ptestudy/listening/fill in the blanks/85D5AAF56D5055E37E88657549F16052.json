    "text": "But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment’s increasing. The main reason for this is the powerplants used to produce electricity. The main source of energy that most of them use is still coal and when it’s burned itreleases mercury into the atmosphere. Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers, and if it’singested by a fish it’s not excreted, it stays in the fish’s body and it enters the food chain So it’s been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected, but what wasn’t known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected."
