    "text": "One cause of unemployment may be downswings in the trade cycle, ie. periods of recession. Another explanation of wide-scale unemployment refers to structural employment.  Structural  unemployment arises from longer-term changes in the economy, affecting  specific industries, regions and occupations. Structural unemployment often explains regional unemployment. Some regions of the UK such as Central Scotland, and the North-West have higher rates of unemployment because the traditional  heavy industries which  located  there have gone into decline as they are replaced  by cheaper imports from abroad. The new high-tech industries based on new technologies tend to be based in the South-East and along particular growth corridors."
