    "text": "Now we would like to look to recent survey conducted by Canadian researchers on diet. Total 31 women volunteered in the survey. They have been told to participate in the exercise program without changing their diet. After careful observation the researchers found that some volunteers experience to body fat change after six months from the day they have started the experiment. The findings further stated that some lost significant amount fat which leads to decrease in body mass. On the other hand, there were others who did not lose fat at all.
