    "text": "Listen to part of a talk in a business management class. management requires a great deal of energy and effort. more than most people care to make. one factor that affects managers and inhibits the capacity to provide leadership is stress. stress has a lot of causes. work overload, criticism from workers and can have negative health effects, including loss of sleep. It’s a fact. Managers have to deal with stress. Some handle it by making time to be by themselves. must have some favorite place or past time a beach to walk on. Maybe a stream to fish in or a game to play with the kids. It’s important to have some form of rest and relaxation. creating art, working with your hands, gardening, playing sports. The list goes on. Rest doesn’t always mean inactivity. for some people exercise is rest."
