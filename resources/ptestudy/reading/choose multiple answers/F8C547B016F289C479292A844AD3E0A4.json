    "text": "Many more people harm themselves or attempt suicide. Admissions to hospital for intentionally self-injury are about 10 times as common as deaths due to suicide. Up to 90% of people who die by suicide suffer from a diagnosable mental illness. Suicide is costly to communities, both economically and socially. Groups most likely to suicide are young males, older men, indigenous young men and rural residents.Suicide is a complex problem with many factors contributing to increase risk. Mental illness (particularly depression) is the most important factor for suicide. When alcohol or drug misuse co-exists with mental illness, there is a greatly increased risk. Previous suicide attempts and poor response to treatment also indicate an elevated risk.Many historical, cultural and physiological factors increase vulnerability, e.g. childhood abuse, family violence, homelessness, social isolation, gambling and other addictions, and experience of recent separation or loss (loved one, job, money, status), anniversaries of significant loss or other events."
