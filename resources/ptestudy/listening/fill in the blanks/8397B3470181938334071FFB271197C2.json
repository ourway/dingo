But a new study suggests that you can feel like you have more time—by donatingsome to others. The research is in the journal Psychological Science. There really are only 24 hours in a day—seven or eight of which are (ideally) spent sleeping. And a time commitment does take time. But researchers found that if people felt like they had done something for others, their perception was that they had gotten more done than people who killed time, spent time on themselves or got unexpectedfree time. And that made them feel like they had more time overall. You don’t even have to spend your whole Sunday volunteering The helping tasks in the study took only about 5 to 15 minutes. They included things like editing a student’s essayor writing a note to a sick child. Time donators also felt like they could do more with their time, making them even more willing to give time in the future."
