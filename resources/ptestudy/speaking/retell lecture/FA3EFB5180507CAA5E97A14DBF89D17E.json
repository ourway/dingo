Studies show they work: Consumers go to their doctor with a suggestion for a certain prescription drug they saw advertised on TV. Now a study in the Annals of Family Medicine raises questions about the message the ads promote . You’re most likely to see drug ads during prime time, especially around the news. Researchers analysed ads aimed at people with conditions like hypertension, herpe, hig cholesterol, depression, arthritis and allergies. The drug industry says the ads arm consumers with information. Researchers found that the information was technically accurate, but the tone was misleading. “Typiclly, what we would see with these ads is that before taking a particular prescription drug, the character’s life is out of control and the loss of control extended beyond the impact of their health condition says UCLA psychologist Dominick Frosch, who headed the study. For example, herpes patients were portrayed as being incapacitated for days. Insomniacs were utterly out of23 synch on the job. Depressed patients were friendless and boring at parties. “When the character is then shown taking the drug, he then magically regains complete control of his life.” Frosch notes. None of the ads mentioned lifestyle changes that could also help treat the condition . That’s not surprising, given that the ads are just another form of mass marketing. But prescription medicines are not soap."
