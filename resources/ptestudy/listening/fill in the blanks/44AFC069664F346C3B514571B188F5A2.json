    "text": "Our Milky Way galaxy has two large  satellitegalaxies orbiting it. They’re known as the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. And humans have been aware of the existence of these celestial objects for at least a millennium. Recently, researchers were curious about whether our configuration is fairly  typical or an astronomical anomaly. In other words, is our corner of the cosmos ordinary? Now a new study finds that the Milky Way and its companion galaxies are an unusual combination, but they’re not one of a kind. Astronomers in the U.K. and Australia looked at thousands of galaxies to try to find an analogue of our arrangementThe search turned up two close replicas: each with a Milky Way–like galaxy accompanied by two galaxies comparableto the Magellanic Clouds. But the researchers also concluded that such arrangements are pretty rare. Only half a percent of Milky Way–like galaxies have companions like ours. The Magellanic Clouds may be transitory features. In a few billion years the Milky Way may absorb them completely. So someday our corner of the cosmos could be pretty ordinary after all."
