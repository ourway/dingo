    "text": "All meetings have one thing in common: role-playing. The most formal role is that of chairman. He sets the agenda, and good chairman will keep the meeting running on time and to the point. Sadly, the other, informal, role-players are often able to gain the upper hand. Chief is the “constant talker”, who just loves to hear his or her own voice.Then there are the “can’t-do” types who want to maintain the status quo. Since they have often been in the organization for a long time, they frequently quote historical experience as an excuse to block changes. A more subtle version of the “can’t-do” type, the “yes, but…”, has emerged recently. They have learnt about the need to sound positive, but they still can’t bear to have things change.Another whole sub-set of characters are people who love meetings and want them to continue. Irrelevant issues are their specialty. They need to call or attend meetings, either to avoid work, or to justify their lack of performance, or simply because they do not have enough to do.Then there are the “counter-dependents”, those who usually disagree with everything that is said, particularly if it comes from the chairman or through consensus from the group. These people need to fight authority in whatever form."
