    "text": "Cities and towns are not only growing in size and number, they are also gaining new influence. The urban transition offers significant opportunities to improve the quality of life, but whether this potential is realized depends critically on how cities are managed and on the national and local policies affecting their development. The development of urban areas is also closely linked  to the rural economy through the exchange of labor, goods, services, information and technology.  Neglecting urban issues leads to significant social and environmental costs, however. In the two most urbanized  regions that the World Bank serves, Latin America and Europe/Central Asia, over half of the poor already live in urban areas. By 2025, two-thirds of the poor in these regions, and one-third of the poor in East and South Asia, will reside in cities or towns. The nature of urban poverty  is more than an income or employment issue, and is also characterized by squalid  living conditions; risks to life and health from poor sanitation  , air pollution, crime and violence, traffic accidents, and natural disasters, and the breakdown of traditional familial and communal safety nets. Urban populations are also particularly hard hit by macro-financial shocks, such as the recent crises in East Asia and Russia. Urban environmental degradation has the most immediate effects on poor urban residents but also has serious national and global impacts."
