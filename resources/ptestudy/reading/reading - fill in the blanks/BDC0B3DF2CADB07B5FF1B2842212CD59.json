    "text": "In the U.S., artists in the mid-1950s began to create abridge to Pop. Strongly influenced by Dada and its emphasis on appropriation and every objects, artists increasingly worked with  collage consumer products, and a healthy dose of irony. Jasper Johns reimagined iconic imagery like the American flag; Robert Rauschenberg employed silkscreen printing and found objects; and Larry Rivers images of mass-produced good. All three are considered to be the forerunners of American Pop."
