Taxonomy is how scientists classify organisms into different groups, based on the characteristics that they share. So for instance, a good way to think about taxonomy is the US postal Service. If we want to send a letter to someone, we first start off by addressing it to the nation they’re in, by default we usually assume that’s American, but it doesn’t have to be England, or Costa Rica or Spain you put their nation, or their kingdom. Then within the kingdom you address it to a slightly more specific level, they’re States so for instance South Carolina would be the same as a phylum and within that state you would address it to their city, and then to their street number, the street they live on then you would address it to say their apartment complex, you’d address it by their last name to their family, and then finally their name to the specific person you want to get in to, and in that way we’re able to weed out all the 4 hundred million people, we don’t want to send our letter to in America and pinpoint the exact person we want the letter to reach. And in the same way scientists use a taxonomy chart to pinpoint a living creature and organism and how it relates to everything else in the world."
