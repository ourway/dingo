    "text": "Learning a language in the classroom is never easy and, quitefrankly ,it’s not the way that most people would choose to learn if they had other options.Having said that, there are plenty of reasons for keeping languages on the school curriculum. For one thing, a fair number of students go on to take jobs in business and commerce that require basic knowledge of a second language, When you talk to young employeesin top companies, it seems that they had a career plan from the start: they were motivated to find additional things to put on their CVs – and of course language is one of those added, but significant extras."
