    "text": "Every year, about 10 million tons of paper winds up in American landfills and incinerators, which is not only wasteful but adds CO2 to the atmosphere  Recycling helps, but even that material has to be repulped and paper ized before you can use it to print out that recipe you ‘ll never make. But what if you could wipe the page clean and use it again? Light amplification by stimulatedemission of radiation to the rescue. A new study shows that laser light can  erase the toner from a piece of printed paper. The approach appears in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A. Taking a page from the art restoration handbookscientists sampled a variety of light sources to see if any could be used to strip the ink from laser printed documents without damaging or discoloring the paper. UV and infrared were too harsh. But a bright green laser applied in 4 nanosecond pulses  vaporizes the print, leaving paper that looks as good as new. Such imprinters will probably run about 30,000 bucks, so they probably will not catch on for home use. But people in the recycling world might find that the green laser fits the  billfor making paper that’s really green."
