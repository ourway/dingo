    "text": "Parents need to take control of the television viewing of Pre-schoolers and children of early school age. A workable techniques is to make a simple but firm weekly plan as to what programs will be permitted and how much time overall may be spent in viewing. Any childâ€™s weekly schedule normally involves a certain amount of time for school, naps, outdoor play and indoor play. There should not, therefore, be great amounts of unfilled time when the child gravitates towards the TV set."
