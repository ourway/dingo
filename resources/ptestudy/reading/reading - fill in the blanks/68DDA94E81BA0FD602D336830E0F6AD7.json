    "text": "Complementary therapies – such as those practiced  by naturopaths, chiropractors and acupuncturists – have become increasingly popular in Australia over the last few decades. Interest initially coincided with enthusiasm for alternative lifestyles, while immigration and increased contact and trade with China have also had an  influence. The status of complementary therapies is being re-visited in a number of areas: legal regulation; the stances of doctors’ associations; their inclusion in medical education; and scientific research into their  efficacy . With the exception of acupuncture, complementary therapies are not routinely funded through Medicare, so there is little administrative data regarding their use. However, the ABS has some data about the use of complementary therapies which can help inform discussion."
