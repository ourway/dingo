We have been studying in fears how to deal with water pollution and yet today we still face the challenges of how we can purify water. There is organization call CBAM foundation that is working on this problem and focusing on human health. Unlike the underdeveloped countries, the developed countries are fortunate and have access to bottle water. They have also water access through the tap. But pure water is still a global problem and we need to solve this as quickly as possible. One solution came by about this is to introduce nanotechnology and both countries that have all have not sufficient water resource nanotechnology will be used to find corresponding solutions and we can expect the problem can be solved very soon"
