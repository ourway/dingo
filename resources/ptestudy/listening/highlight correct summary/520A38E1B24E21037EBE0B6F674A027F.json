      "There are both advantages and disadvantages of social media in the workplace. On one side, a companyâs brand can become stronger. On the other side, there is a chance that the companyâs brand will become weaker if an employee says something negative about the company.",
      "Because social media can stop employees working, some employers prevent them from using social media. However, these employers do not enjoy the benefits that social media can bring, such as an increase in customer demand for their product or a stronger brand.",
      "Social media can help employers to develop their businesses and find new staff. However, it is a problem when an employee criticises the company online or spends too much time using social media. To stop employees spending time on social media, employers must develop and challenge their staff.",
      "Employers only see the negative side of social media because they have too many problems with employees being rude or spending too much time using social media instead of working. Because this situation is challenging, it is easier for companies to stop the use of social media."
