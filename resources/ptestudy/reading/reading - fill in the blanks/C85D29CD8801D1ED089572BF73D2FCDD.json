    "text": "Music is an important part of our lives. We connect and interact with it daily and use it as a way of projecting our self-identities to the people around us. The music we enjoy — whether it’s country or classical, rock n’ roll or rap — reflects  who we are. But where did music, at its core, first come from? It’s a puzzling question that may not have a definitive answer. One  leading researcher, however, has proposed that the key to understanding the origin of music is nestled snugly in the loving bond between mother and child. In a lecture at the University of Melbourne, Richard Parncutt, an Australian-born professor of systematic musicology, endorsed the idea that music originally spawned from ‘motherese’ — the playful voices mothers adopt  when speaking to  infants  and toddlers."
