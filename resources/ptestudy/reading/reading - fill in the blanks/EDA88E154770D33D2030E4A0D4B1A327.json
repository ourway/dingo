    "text": "Descendants of the Maya living in Mexico still sometimes refer to themselves as ‘the corn people’. The phrase is not intended as metaphor. Rather, it’s mean toacknowledge their abiding dependence on this miraculous grass, the staple_of their diet for almost 9000 years. The supermarket itself-the wallboard and joint compound, the linoleum and fiberglass and adhesives out of which the building itself has been built-is in no small measure a  manifestation _of corn."
