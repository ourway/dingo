    "text": "Now I like the history and one thing I want to go over briefly is a history of epigenetic research and this is from my perspective now. I got into this field in the early 90s. And what I have here is plotted publications total publications and function of time here. And on a linear graph. So what I did for this is I wanted to show that basically up until around the year 2000. There’s an inflection point right around two thousand five right in here where it looks like basically nothing really is happening much in the field of epigenetics. To the point where it’s actually going vertical and a lot is happening in field of epigenetics. Now if you plot this rather than on linear paper semi-log paper. What you will find is that what I’m showing is an exponential growth curve for publications in the field of epigenetics. And that in the scientific community. There’s a doubling of the epigenetics papers every one and a half to two years. Last year alone we put into publication summers between fifteen and twenty thousand papers which took us 15 years from 1992 to 2005."
