      "Global cooling has taken place on Earth in the past and the Little Ice Age lasted from around 1300 to 1800. Some scientists think changes in Earthâs orbit make the temperature drop, and a lack of sunspots might affect temperatures on Earth.",
      "The temperatures in the Northern and Southern hemispheres decreased during the Little Ice Age. There was less rain in summer during this period, which resulted in a lack of food.",
      "Global cooling will occur soon due to sunspots, which will further result in the average temperatures on Earth dropping. As a result, the ice pack in the Arctic Ocean will grow larger and move south."
