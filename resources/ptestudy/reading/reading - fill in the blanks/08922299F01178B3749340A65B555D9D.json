    "text": "Language comes so naturally to us that it is easy to forget what a strange and miraculous gift it is. All over the world members of our  species  fashion their breath into hisses and hums and squeaks and pops and listen to others do the  same . We do this, of course , not only because we like the sounds but because details of the sounds contain information about the  intentions  of the person making them. We humans are fitted with a means of sharing  our ideas, in all their unfathomable vastness. When we listen to speech, we can be led to think thoughts that have  never been thought before and that never would have occurred  to us on our own."
