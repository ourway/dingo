    "text": "Architectural engineering is a specific field of engineering that deals more with structures and buildings. We’re familiar with architects being the designers of buildings but engineers also are a large part of that process. And often we find that architects and engineers going to work together on a building are talking two different languages. The beauty of architectural engineering is that these engineers understand design from an architect’s perspective and so are able to much better help architects in creating buildings and places. If you look at the work of Santiago Calatrava, who’s probably one of most famous architectural engineers in the world, his work does that; he pushes materials; he makes concrete do things that feathers should do. That’s the beauty. Architecture isn’t just about you know what it looks like from the outside; that it’s much more integrated than that, and also getting architects to understand that engineers are just as creative and incredible designers as architects can be, but that they each have different skills, and how can we get those working together in the best possible way."
