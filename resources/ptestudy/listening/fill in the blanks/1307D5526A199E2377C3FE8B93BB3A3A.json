    "text": "Modern wealth has been created mainly through the action of market forces, which now dominate the whole of the industrial world. It is based on the  false  premise that we all start at an equal point. Of course nobody starts at the same point. Market forces help a few to become very wealthy at the expense the many who become poorer. This is taking place all over the world. There is an increasing number of hungry and desperate people living in utter poverty. Yet there are millionaires of all nationalities throughout the developed world. Market forces are inevitably acting to divide our world because they  separate one section of society from another. Strangely enough, to create a society based on the free play of market forces, there must be a very strict control over the economy to ensure business efficiency. This is the poison of commercialization . It imposes restrictions on the natural needs of society. When the politicians are not meeting the needs of society, the people revolt  . When the people’s voice is not heard, there will inevitably be revolution . Part of that revolution is the growing crime rate and the violent street protests which are the result of the imbalance of our society — too great wealth side by side with too great poverty."
