    "text": "Um, I’m responsible for studentadmissions to the college and I use a computer system to help process student enrollments and to do the timetabling But it really doesn’t suit the way we work these days. It’s over ten years old and although it was fine when it was first introduced it is just not good enough now. 20 years ago, the college was quite small and we didn’t have the number of students and tutorsthat we have now. There’s a lot more data now and it sometimes seems the system has crashed but, in fact, it just takes ages to go from onescreen  to the next."
