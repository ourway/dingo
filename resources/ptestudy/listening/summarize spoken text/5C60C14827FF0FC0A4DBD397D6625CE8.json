They who know within a year or two, when they accumulate that kind of debt. They never able to pay back. Where is the debt coming from? It’s coming from a seed that is costing a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand rupees per kilogram, depending on what you got. Seed that used to be free, used to be theirs. Pesticides each time, they more they use, the more they have to use, 12 sprays, 15 sprays, 20 sprays. Pesticides used in just the last five years in the land areas of India has showed up by 2000 percent. That’s why the free market and globalization have brought and since we are talking about peasants, who have no money, who have no capital, they can only by expensive seeds and expensive pesticides by borrowing. And who lend that money? The seed companies that sell the pesticides, which are the same companies that sell the seeds, as you know, are now also the major creditors."
