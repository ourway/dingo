When we’ve recently, when at UCL Center for Sustainable Heritage, we’ve recently been asked to access the environment at another historical library at Saint Paul’s Cathedral, the Wren Library, an incredible place. And it has a such an intensive smell of old books. And we were also asked for the first time really I was actually taken aback by the brief, we were asked whatever you do please preserve the smell. It is so important to our audience. It is so important how people perceive the library. So that is, that was quite an important message in our research. And indeed, the smell is an important way of how we communicate with the environment. This piece of research was done by an advertising company because advertisers are so interested in how we how we interact with each other and the environment. And we see that the majority of people use sight obviously to interact with the environment, but on the second place, we see the smell is also very, very important."
