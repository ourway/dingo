    "text": "Clones of an Eastern cottonwood (Populusdeltoides) in the Bronx and other city spots grew to double the biomass of clones plantedoutside small towns upstate or on Long Island, says Jillian Gregg, now of the Environmental Protection Agency’s western-ecology division in Corvallis, Ore. The growth gap comes from ozone damage, she and her New York colleagues report. Ozone chemists have known that concentrationsmay spike skyscraper high in city air, but during a full 24 hours, rural trees actually get a higher cumulative ozone exposure from urban pollution that blows in and lingers. A series of new experiments now shows that this hang-around ozone is the overwhelmingfactor in tree growth, the researchers say in the July 10 Nature. “This study has profound importance in showing us most vividly that rural areas paythe price for [urban] pollution,” says Stephen P. Long of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “This work should be a wake-up call,” he adds."
