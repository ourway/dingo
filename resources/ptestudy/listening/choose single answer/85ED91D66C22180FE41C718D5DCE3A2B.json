    "text": "So, I want to discuss dissertations now. Our experience is that final year undergraduates and Masters students can struggle to find a suitable topic for their dissertation. Often they’re not able to come up with a viable or suitable area to research. Another problem may be that the topiC they choose is too broad and needs to be refined.So. anyway, eventually their proposal is submitted and approved but then. after some background reading or a deeper consideration of research methods they may well want to modify their original proposal. to some extent. Well, that’s fine. We expect modifications as the work progresses. This is normal. What we don’t want to happen is that the student repeatedly wants to completely change the whole approved topic or original proposal to something completely new, and that does happen at times."
