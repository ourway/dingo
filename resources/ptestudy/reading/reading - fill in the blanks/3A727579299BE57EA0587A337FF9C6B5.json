    "text": "The American cabinet, unlike the British, has no connection with the legislature, and this lack of  coordination  between executive and legislature is one of the  distinctive  features of American federal government. It came as a reaction against George Ill’s very intimate relations with the House of Commons. The Constitution guarded  against  executive control through “place- men” by  disqualifying  federal officials."
