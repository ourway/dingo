    "text": "I suppose more and more, people are starting to see graffiti as a form of art. Now there are still many who would beg to differ – and they’d point to the destructive scribblings that we see on our bus shelters and our public buildings . These often take the form of tags which are fancy, scribble-like versions of someone’s name or nick-name. Tags generally have no aesthetic appeal and they are the scourge of the high street shopkeeper in many a town. I can certainly see where the shopkeepers and property owners are coming from. But the fact is, graffiti has been around for a very long time indeed. People left their mark on cave walls back in prehistoric times and it’s been found too on ancient monuments in Egypt and Rome . But New York style graffiti – which is really the forerunner of a lot of the graffiti that’s getting done now – New York graffiti took off in the late 1960s. That’s when the advent of the spraycan allowed the humble tag to evolve into more complex styles . In the mid to late 70s, subway trains became the new forum for graffiti artists to display their skills. For many young people it became a medium to express their disillusionment with a system from which they felt excluded. Now of course, the art establishment embraces graffiti artists and some of these artists have actually taken on cult status."
