      "This book is chock-a-block full of intrusive stories and practical advice, describing Carton’s activities at Vingresor (where he assumed his first presidency at age 32), Linjeflug, and SAS in particular",
      "He began at Vingresor as an order giver, not a listener neither to his people nor to his customers and made every mistake in the book.",
      "By the time he got to Linjeflug four years later, he had learned many lessons, in fact, he began his second stint as top dog by calling the entire company together in a hanger and asking for help, a far cry from his barking out commands just 48 months back",
      "At SAS, he arrived at a time crisis"
