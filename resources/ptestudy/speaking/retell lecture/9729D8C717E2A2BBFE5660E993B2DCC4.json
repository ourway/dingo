    "text": "Before we adjourn, I’d like to remind everybody about the upcoming fundraising event-the ten kilometer run. The run is being organized to help raise money for the renovation of the old gym. Our gym is in desperate need of repair, and the university must rely entirely on private donations to pay for its renovation. This event will be the students’ contribution to the effort. The procedure for participating is quite simple. No entrance fees, no advance registration, and you don’t have to be the best athlete on campus. You only need to find sponsors willing to contribute one or more dollars for every kilometer of the race that you complete. So, for example, if you run all ten kilometers, you’ll collect ten dollars from someone who has pledged to give you one dollar per kilometer. After the run, a race official will record the number of kilometers you’ve completed. You can then show the record to your sponsors when you collect the money. You might encourage your friends to run in the race by telling them that there will be awards for everyone who gets five sponsors or more. But above all, it’ll just be a lot of fun. So, please spread the word and get everyone involved either as runners or sponsors."
