I’m going to be focusing on things that you need to consider to ensure your website really adds value to the people using it. So – there are three main areas you need to think about. The first and most important thing is who is your target audience? When you’re creating a new website you really need to think about who the users are and what information they’ll be looking for. What we do when we set up websites is to group users based on their needs. So, for a website in the academic community, for example, we may have groups such as researchers and administrators, and this helps us design the site and add information that is relevant to each group. The second point is accessibility. The main thing here is to ensure your website can be found . And you can do this by making sure it can be reached from areas on the web where your target audience are also active. So this may mean providing links on other websites or maybe using social media. And thirdly – retention-making sure your target audience return to your website regularly. You do this by ensuring it gives them a reason to come back. So it’s important to keep the site up-to-date and make sure it provides the latest news and interesting information and so on."
