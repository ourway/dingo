    "text": "Chemistry is an extremely important topic in physiology. Most physiological processes occur as the  result  of chemical changes that occur within the body. These changes include the influx/efflux of ions across a neuronâ€™s membrane, causing a  signal  to pass from one end to the other. Other examples include the  storage  of oxygen in the blood by a protein as it  passes  through the lungs for usage throughout the body."
