My answer would be we should open up our borders and we should fight for the free movement for all no ifs no point systems no buts no categories and we should do this because the freedom of movement should be enjoyed universally. I would argue for the freedom of movement for all from a humanist point of view where the desire to speak a better life to move around the world is the germ of the history making process. without it we would all stand still. And I think actually this is a shining example of what makes us human. And I think we should look forward to more people. Because more people are more pair of hands more creators more thinkers more brain cells. more people means more aliens, more mates, more love affairs."
