    "text": "But they also have one of the largest gender pay gaps in sales jobs — data from the mid ’90s show that women made 20 percent less than men. But stockbrokers are usually paid through  commissions which should reduce gender inequality, as income would be based solely on ability. Unless women aren’t as good at the job, or clients simply made fewer  purchases from women brokers. Or can management still play a role in women making less? University of Pennsylvania sociologist Janice Fading Madden reviewed info from two major brokerage houses availablevia class action lawsuits. The data included stockbrokers’ records of asset  values and trades from 1994 through ’96. Madden found that there were no sales differences by gender for accounts with prior sales histories. But the referrals that women got from management had lower asset values and historic commissions. So the managers effectively gave them lower paying accounts. The research is in the journal Gender and Society. The study shows that manager bias can affect whether women make as much as men—even when the manager isn’t the one paying."
