    "text": "People rarely translate another person’s unique way of saying things with any degree of accuracy  . This is because when we learn the meaning of words, we pick up their broad meaning but we’ve added subtle shades of difference which we get from our personal experiences. If you grew up in an aggressive household, the phrase ‘I’m angry with you’ had different associations than for a person from a family where people talked through problems. We’re left having to work out meaning from our own experience. So despite the fact that, say, Bob and Gina are both speaking English, Bob is really speaking ‘Bob-English’ and Gina is turning that into ‘Gina-English’ and the translation is never going to be perfect."
