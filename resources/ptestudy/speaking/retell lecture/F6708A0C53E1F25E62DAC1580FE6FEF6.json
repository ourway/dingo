And so the Arctic was named after the Greek word for bear . now surprisingly it’s not after the polar bears that live in Antarctic and live in the Arctic and space after the little and Great Bear constellations that can be seen in the sky now the Greeks also hypothesize that there would be an Anti-Arctic which is how we get the name Antarctic and that’s because it wasn’t discovered until much later on now these regions are opposite in many ways other than just their names and their location on the globe and so we look at the arts accessible and the Arctic is actually ocean surrounded by land so you can see here this is UK down here and it’s kind of Russia and then American Canada around here. and so there is a bit of land recognize and ice in the under in the Arctic which is Greenland here and but mostly all this area here surprisingly a lot of people don’t realize that this isn’t actually land the North Pole isn’t on land it’s just one big ocean and see if you have to go to the North Pole you could stand on it if you were drill down through the ice you would find ocean."
