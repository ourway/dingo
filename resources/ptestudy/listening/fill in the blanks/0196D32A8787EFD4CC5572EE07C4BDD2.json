    "text": "Popular ride-sharing firm Uber has had its licence to operate in London revokedin a surprise move by the city’s regulator. There were multiple reasons for the decision. TfL cited the company’s approach to reporting criminal offences. In August, a senior officer within London’s Metropolitan Police Service wrote to TfL about Uber’s slowness to report a passenger’s accusationthat her driver had sexually assaultedher. TfL said it was also concerned about how Uber obtained medical certificates and criminal records checks for drivers. The straw that broke the camel’s back may have been the company’s “Greyball” software – an internal application that Uber may have used to block regulators’ oversightof the Uber app."
