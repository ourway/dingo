    "text": "Using the Internet has become anormal part of everyday life for many people. They use it to book airline tickets, or toaccess  news about world events, or to follow the fortunes  of their favorite football club. Millions of people across the world belong to social networking groups where they keep in touch with their friends and, if they live away from them, their family. In my opinion, these are all good ways to use the Internet."
