    "text": "There are a few different types of psychotic symptoms which we will review individually. Hallucinations are hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting or smelling something that isn’t really there. This sensation has no external stimuli. Due to the lack of insight these individuals think that what they perceive is real. Schizophrenia is usually associated with auditory hallucinations where the individual hears voices. Tactile Hallucinations like the sensation of bugs crawling on their skin is usually related to street drugs. Olfactory (smell) hallucinations are more commonly seen in the aura before seizures. Delusions are strongly held beliefs that are not based on fact. Due to the lack of insight trying to convince a psychotic person that their delusions are false is almost impossible no matter of how much evidence you present. Delusions of Persecution are the most common type and involve paranoia. These individuals think others are “out to get them” and are trying to follow them, spy on them, poison them, steal from them or otherwise harm them. Delusions of Grandeur are when an individual believes that have special powers, talents or intellect. They may think they are famous, have supernatural abilities or have religious prominence. Other common themes in delusion are guilt, thought control, thought broadcasting (belief that others can hear your thoughts) and ideas of reference (belief that people on TV/radio/print media are talking about you)."
