    "text": "An important question about education is, then, why do some types of students achieve success easily and others struggle to do well? Well, one theory is that there is a geneticreason for academic achievement. What I mean by that is, a certain innate, measurable level of intelligence .Another frequently discussed theory is environmental factors, such as the effect of home and family upbringing.
