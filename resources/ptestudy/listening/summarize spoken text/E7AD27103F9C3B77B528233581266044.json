And it’s possible to express all forms of power consumption using this unit of the light bulb. I started measuring everything around my house, around my office. And I found some surprising things. First, I plug in a phone charger. And it didn’t even register on this power meter. It uses one hundredth of a light bulb of power. So I don’t think the phone chargers can be our NO.1 phone energy consumption. Just taking one hot bath everyday uses the same energy, same power of five light bulbs on all the time, non-stop. And I found I’ve been steadily using 40 light bulbs worth of gas for heating, making hot air or hot water. And that surprises me. Transport is one of the biggest forms of energy consumption, and it uses about a third about our energy. If you drive an average car 50 kilometers a day, that corresponds to adding 40 light bulbs on all the time. Today, the average British person is using 125 light bulbs of power. That’s 125 light bulbs on all the time, non-stop. That’s huge."
