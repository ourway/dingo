    "answer": "Theme: lifehealthTechnology & InventionThese days, deaths are highly concentrated at older ages and this could only be possible with advances in medical care. This increase in average life expectancy can be regarded as one of society’s greatest achievements but some people don’t see it as a positive development.  Some reports suggest that the average age of death has been increased in 2016. Though the trend is encouraging as now our near and dear ones live longer. The data shows that humans are making the right health-related decisions and this achievement can be attributed to improvement in public health and medical care. This can be cited as a great achievement for individuals and society but it also means many countries facing an aging population.  With the improvement in life expectancy, there has been a 10 fold increase in the oldest people that now constitute the fastest-growing part of the total population. There are more people of older age throughout the World. This also means the extra financial burden on families having more older people. As human age grows we get more vulnerable to diseases and sickness. The regular health checkups and constant observation of health care experts are usually expensive and it can burn a hole in the patient’s family. It’s good that one can stay for long years with his or her family and enjoy happy moments but financial burden can cause conflict within the family.For the reasons discussed above I can conclude that an increase in average life expectancy rate can put the burden on the environment and society but it can be dealt with jointly by individuals and society. After all longer longevity is a symbol of growing civilization and the better life."
