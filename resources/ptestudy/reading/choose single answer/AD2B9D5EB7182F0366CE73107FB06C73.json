  },
  {
    "text": "Crime victims are often called to apprehend the offender who attempted to hurt, kill or rob them. Victim’s testimony is considered enough to establish guilt of the accused. There are times when victims do not make reliable witnesses. This often happens because the victim is overcome with fear and hence he or she either focuses on the weapon being used to cause harm or closes eyes due to shock. Consequently, they cannot take see the attacker properly. In 2009, there were 300 such cases which rose to 379 in year 2015. While we can conclude that the testimony of crime victim is not always inaccurate, the conclusion also demands that victim’s identification is not the automatic proof of guilt."
