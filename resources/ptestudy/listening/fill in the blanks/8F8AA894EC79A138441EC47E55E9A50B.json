    "text": "The Nile River is the most important source of water in Egypt. It begins in the highlands south of Egypt, where there is a large amount of rain. It flows almost 6500kms across the desert before it empties into the Mediterranean Sea. The long, thin strips along each side of the Nile River are the most fertile parts of Egypt, where Egyptians have farmed the land since ancient times."
