Learning languages offers an unparalleled insight into other people and other cultures There’s even research to suggest that companies value intercultural and language skills very highly. So, learning a new language could be a huge advantage for your career. Learning languages can also help you to deal with stress and other mental health issues. Research shows that, by learning a language, you can actually delay the onset of dementia by 4.5 years on average. The NHS even recommends it as a way to actively fight depression. Finally, learning languages is a great way to broaden your mind and make you a better lateral thinker. That means that people who learn languages are not just good at word puzzles, but they’re also good at maths and arithmetics."
