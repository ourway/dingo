      "DNA barcoding was invented by Paul Hebert of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, Canada, in 2003. His idea was to creategetreceivegenerategenerate a unique identification tag for each species based on a short blendbleachstretchsketchstretch of DNA. Separating species would then be a simple task of sequencing this tiny bit of DNA. Dr Hebert proposed part of a gene called cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) as suitable to the task. All animals have it. It seems to vary enough, but not too much, to act as a reliable marker. And it is easily examinedfoundextractedbrokeextracted , because it is one of a handful of genes found outside the cell nucleus, in structures called mitochondria.",
