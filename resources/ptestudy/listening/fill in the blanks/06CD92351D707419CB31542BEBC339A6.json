    "text": "Each year on the third Monday of January schools, federal offices, post office and banks across America close as we celebrate the newest American national holiday. 15 years after Dr. King’s death President Ronald Reagan signed a bill into law making the third Monday of January a national holiday celebrating the birth and life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But it was a tough time getting the bill passed. First a bill had to be introduced by a member of the House of Representatives. The Speaker of the House assigned the bill to a committee where the bill was discussed in detail. Meetings were held where supporters and opponents could discuss their positions. The committee then agreed that bill should be sent to a vote. The Rules Committee scheduled a debate on the issue. The House of Representatives then voted on the bill. It passed the House with a  vote of 338 to 90. Then it was sent to the Senate. Again the issue of the King holiday had to pass through committees and public hearings before a final vote was taken. There were many who opposed the idea. America had only honored two individuals with national holidays — George Washington and Christopher Columbus. Many felt that there were other Americans that deserved a national holiday, such as Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy."
