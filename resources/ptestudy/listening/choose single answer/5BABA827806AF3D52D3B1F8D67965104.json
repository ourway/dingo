  {
    "text": "The Beehive is the common name for the Executive Wing of the New Zealand Parliament Buildings. so-called because its shape is very much like a traditional woven beehive. It’s ten storeys high with the levels becoming incrementally smaller, the higher up they are.  Scottish architect Sir Basil Spence did the original conceptual design in 1964 but the detailed design of the building was by the Ministry of Worl When it was built, it was supposed to embody the spirit of New Zealand as a nation but ifs never really had that recognition in the way that buildings like, say, the Sydney Opera House have had. In a way, I suppose the Beehive was – for a long time – seen as an unfortunate hangover from the I960s, but time has passed to the point where people’s feelings about it have gone through a kind of ironic celebration to real appreciation now."
