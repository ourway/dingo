    "text": "So, it turns out the frogs like I mentioned before are incredibly diverse, so over 7000 species and many of them are nocturnal so they live, you know , they only come out at night but there are some that come out during the daytime and many of the ones that come out in the daytime have really bright colors and the blue frogs are the poison dart frogs is one type of blue. There are many blue frogs actually, but one type is called the poison dart frog and the reason they’re called that is because the native people in the Amazon who set in South America used to capture these and take little darts and roll them on the skin of the frog and they’d use that to shoot the monkeys out of the trees, and it’s because these frogs are incredibly toxic. They have neurotoxins on their skin, so they wear their armor basically on the outside of their skin. One of the things that makes frogs or amphibians different from other vertebrates is that they have special glands that produce defensive compounds, mostly toxins that if something tries to bite them they get the toxin in their mouths and then what happens to that predator is that their muscles stop working so they literally can’t bite and they stop breathing. So, some of them are really dangerous actually and most of the ones that are dangerous are out in the daytime, so they’re flaunting their colours they have very bright either reds or blues or oranges and they’re basically showing off their poisonous nests in a sense."
