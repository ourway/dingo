    "text": "Most of the energy we use in the United States and throughout the world is wasted by inefficient technology for turning energy into the services we want like hot showers and cold beer. So in the United States for example we could save half the oil we use and get exactly the same or better services out of it by redoubling the efficiency of using it that would cost on average twelve dollars per saved barrel and condensed of course several times less than what we pay for oil. We could save half the natural gas at about fifth of its price we could save at least three quarters of the electricity at about an eight of its price and the technologies to do this already exist even though we can make them a lot better. Now to protect the climate we need to raise the global rate of saving energy that is reducing energy use per unit of economic activity not by the historic 1% a year. But we need to raise that up to about three or four percent a year. However the US has often done that without even paying attention California’s the percentage point faster than that China’s a point faster than that they did over five percent a year for a quarter century."
