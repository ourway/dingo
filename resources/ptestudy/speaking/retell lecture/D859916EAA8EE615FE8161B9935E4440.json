    "text": "The British standards institution is a service organization that produces standards across a wide variety of industry sectors. All products must have a BSI license to get access into the market. There are two types of standard. One is compulsory, and the other one is elective. Under the compulsory standard, the products cannot come into the market unless they meet the requirements . Otherwise, without the license, these products will be seen as illegal. This is for the purpose of safety. Take matchboxes as an example."
