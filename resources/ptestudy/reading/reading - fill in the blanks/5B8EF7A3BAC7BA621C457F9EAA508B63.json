    "text": "Traditionally, mass-communications research has conceptualized the process of communication in terms of a circulation circuit or loop. This  model  has been criticized for its linearity – sender/ message /receiver – for its concentration on the level of message exchange and for the absence of a structured conception of the different moments as a complex structure of relations. But it is also possible and  useful to think of this process in terms of a structure produced and sustained through the articulation of linked  but distinctive moments – production, circulation, distribution/consumption, reproduction. This would be to think of the  process  as a “complex structure in dominance’, sustained through the articulation of connected practices, each of which, however, retains its distinctiveness and has its own  specific  modality, its own forms and conditions of existence."
