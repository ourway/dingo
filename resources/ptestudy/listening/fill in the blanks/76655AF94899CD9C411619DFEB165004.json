    "text": "That brings us to the CEO’s second duty: building everyone or more accurately, building the senior team. All the executives report to the CEO, so it’s the CEO’s job to hire  fire, and manage the executive team. From coaching CEOs, I actually think this is the most important skill of all. Because when a CEO hires an excellent senior team, that team can keep the company running. when a CEO hire a poor senior team, the CEO is up spending  all of their time trying to do with the team, and not nearly enough time trying to do with other elements of their job. The senior team can and often does develop  the strategy for the company, but ultimately it’s always the CEO who has the final ‘go-no-go’ decision on strategy."
