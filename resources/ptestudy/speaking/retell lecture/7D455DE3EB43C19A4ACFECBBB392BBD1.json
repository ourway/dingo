Ok, we have a monkey sitting at a typewriter and the claim here is basically if you leave chance in time long enough you will get life, don’t worry about it, yes, it’s strange, yes, it’s wonderful, but leave enough matter 600 million years on earth and you will have life. So, the monkey sitting at the typewriter the chances are eventually he produces the complete works of Shakespeare so what’s the problem. So, there’s no problem. There’s no issue, right? You just leave it long enough and you’ll find. And one key striker seconds, the monkey might well eventually get to you the complete works of Shakespeare but he doesn’t manage to do it in 600 million years. So, what I decided to do is to run the numbers. I, instead of saying typing the complete work of Shakespeare, I just run the numbers for how long would it take a monkey typing one key striker a second. To type “to be or not to be that is the question’. Right? On average how long is it gonna take my monkey friend one keystroke a second? I don’t know how you think it would be. Maybe you could have a guess. Would it be less or more than 600 million years, which is the period life on earth isn’t supposed to have emerged within and when I run the numbers” to be or not to be is the question’ takes 12.6 trillion trillion trillion years to type just that phrase and a DNA string has got as much as information the Encyclopedia Britannica. Are we saying that something of that complexity emerges by chance undirected within 600 million years? Again, it’s mathematically possible but it’s so incredibly unlikely that it would have that it tilts me in favor of the Christian story in which God created life, simply a question of saying let that be and there was.."
