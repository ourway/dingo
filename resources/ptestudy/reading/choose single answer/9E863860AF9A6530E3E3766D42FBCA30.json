    "question": "How can we, according to the writer, come across as unprofessional in meetings?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Communication skills basically involve being able to put your message across clearly and effectively both orally (for example, in meetings) and in writing (reports and records). Unfortunately, both these areas have been undervalued in the past and have not received the attention they deserve in terms of, for example, training and development. There is therefore a need to make sure that we do not come across as unprofessional in meetings through a lack of presentation skills and ‘skimp’ on records and reports because we feel unconfident in writing them effectively or do not appreciate their significance – many disastrous mistakes have occurred because of poor or non-existent written communication."
