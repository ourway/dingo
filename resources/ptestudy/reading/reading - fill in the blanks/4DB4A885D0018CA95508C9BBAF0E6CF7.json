    "text": "The allure of the book has always been negative and  positive , for the texts and pictures between the covers have helped many young readers to  discover  and grasp the world around them in a pleasurable and meaningful way. But the allure has also enabled authors and publishers to prey upon young readersâ€™ dispositions and desires and to  sell  them a menu that turns out to be junk food. The texts and pictures titillate children or reinforce certain formulaic patterns of thinking that reduce the possibility for the child to develop his or her own creative and critical talents."
