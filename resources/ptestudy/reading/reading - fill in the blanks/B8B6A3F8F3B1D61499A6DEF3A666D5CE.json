    "text": "The first banks were  probably the religious temples of the ancient world, and were probably established sometime during the third  millennium B.C. Banks probably  predatedthe invention of money. Deposits initially consisted of grain and later other goods including cattle, agricultural implements, and eventually precious metals such as gold, in the form of easy-to-carry compressed plates. Temples and palaces were the safest places to store gold as they were constantly attended and well built. As sacred places, temples  presented  an extra deterrent to would-be thieves."
