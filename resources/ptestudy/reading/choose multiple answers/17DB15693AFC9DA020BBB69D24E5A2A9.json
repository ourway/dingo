    "text": "The only purpose behind alien space travelers visiting Earth back then as suggested by Stephen Hawking, was to send one-way colonists to augment the size and distribution of their race. With sufficient time, that scenario is most likely to play out more than once. According to Hawking, Earth’s only hope in defense will be the applicability of the laws of physics across the universe. Besides, the foundation of the very belief is that by the time the interstellar invaders arrive, human race itself will have discovered and deployed similar defense systems that would allow Earth to defend itself. If we go by the definition, speculation about futurity is termed as fiction, but as it appears on the basis of Hawking’s school of thought, the science fiction may well get closer to the truth than we would like."
