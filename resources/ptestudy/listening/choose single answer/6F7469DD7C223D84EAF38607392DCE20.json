    "text": "I can’t believe how much my books costs the semester. I just spent over $100 in the University bookstore for only four blocks and I still need the book for chemistry that would cost $55 it’s a little more than my budget can handle at the moment. science books are always out of sight, but did you know there’s another bookstore in the pioneer district. They carry use copies of most of the textbooks for the University. I wonder if it have my chemistry book. I mean, the third edition. I found all of my books there. you can sell any kind of book too, not just textbooks. that’s not a bad idea. When you say that was again."
