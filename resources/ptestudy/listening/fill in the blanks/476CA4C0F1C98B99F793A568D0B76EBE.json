    "text": "Post-modernism is broadly speaking a reaction against the movement or the period, or perhaps simply the values and beliefs of, modernism. Most people, even those who seem to know what it is or was about, tend to define it in negative  terms by telling us what it isn’t, or doesn’t do. Initially  the term had a fairly limited application and referred to a new anti-modernist style of architecture. But it spread like a virus to include almost all aspects of contemporary culture. One thing we can be sure about is that it wanted to get rid of what were called the grand narratives by which we explained how the world – and history – got us from the past to the present. Another feature of post-modernism is its belief that truth and reality are human-centered and internal  . That is, the primary source  of truth in the present age is the self. This, I believe, has now all passed and been thrown in the rubbish bin of history. Yet it is difficult to know whether the age of information technology confirms the passing of post-modernism or is a consequence of it."
