    "text": "Cuteness in offspring is a potent protective mechanism that ensures survival for otherwise completely dependentinfants. Previous research has linked cuteness to early ethological ideas of a “kindchenschema” (infant schema) where infant facial features serve as “innate releasing mechanisms” for instinctualcaregiving behaviors. We propose extending the concept of cuteness beyond visual features to include positive infant sounds and smells. Evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies links this extended concept of cuteness to simple “instinctual” behaviors and to caregiving protection and complex emotions. We review how cuteness supports key parental capacities byignitingfast privileged neural activity followed by slower processing in large brain networks also involved in the play, empathy, and perhaps even higher-order moral emotions."
