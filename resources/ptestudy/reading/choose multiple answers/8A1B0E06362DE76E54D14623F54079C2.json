    "text": "Inundated by more information than we can possibly hold in our heads, we are increasingly handing off the job of remembering to search engines and smart phones. Google is even reportedly working on eyeglasses that could one day recognize faces and supply details about whoever you are looking at. But new research shows that outsourcing our memory – and expecting that information will be continually and instantaneously available – is changing our cognitive habits.Research conducted by Betsy Sparrow, an assistant professor of psychology at Columbia University, has identified three new realities about how we process information in the Internet age. First, her experiments showed that when we do not know the answer to a question, we now think about where we can find the nearest Web connection instead of the subject of the question itself. A second revelation is that when we expect to be able to find information again later on, we do not remember it as well as when we think it might become unavailable. And then there is the researchers’ final observation: the expectation that we will be able to locate information down the line leads us to form a memory not of the fact itself but of where we will be able to find it.Last, there is the possibility, increasingly terrifying to contemplate, that our machines will fail us. As Sparrow puts it, “The experience of losing our Internet connection becomes more and more like losing a friend.” If you are going to keep your memory on your smart phone, better make sure it is fully charged."
