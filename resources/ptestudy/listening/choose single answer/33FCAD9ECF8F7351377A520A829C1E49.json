    "text": "Florida businesses will lose more money from crime this year than they’ll spend on water, gas and electricity. This is according to a study released Tuesday. From shoplifting to employee theft, crime is expected to cost Florida businesses $27.4 billion. The cost is twice that of residential crime, according to the report issued by Attorney General Charlie Crist and a law enforcement/industry coalition.  The biggest perpetrators, surprisingly, are not robbers and burglars. Rather, they are rogue employees, pilfering everything from stock inventory and office supplies to company accounts and confidential data. More than $13 billion in losses almost half of Florida’s annual total are attributed to those inside jobs, the study said. State officials said they are launching a campaign to inform the public and business community about the problem."
