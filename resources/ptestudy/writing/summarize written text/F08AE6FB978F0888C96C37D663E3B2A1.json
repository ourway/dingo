The greatest climate change Whereas the fundamental essence of the greatest climate change emphasizes the significance of the ice age, the corresponding impacts of the warm interglacial period such as the temperature rise and the atmospheric CO2 are acknowledged, and a greenhouse gas could be inferred evidently from the Earth heat radiation, which the potential implications of the natural climate variations as well as Antarctic temperatures are presumed.

    "text": "The greatest climate change the world has seen in the last 100,000 years was the transition from the ice age to the warm interglacial period. New research from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen indicates that, contrary to the previous opinion, the rise in temperature and the rise in the atmospheric CO2 follow each other closely in terms of time. The results have been published in the scientific journal, Climate of the Past.  In the warmer climate, the atmospheric content of CO2 is naturally higher. The gas CO2 (carbon dioxide) is a greenhouse gas that absorbs heat radiation from Earth and thus keeps Earth warm. In the shift between ice ages and interglacial periods, the atmospheric content of CO2 helps to intensify the natural climate variations.  It had previously been thought that as the temperature began to rise at the end of the ice age approximately 19,000 years ago, an increase in the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere followed with a delay of up to 1,000 years.  “Our analysis of ice cores from the ice sheet in Antarctica shows that the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere follows the rise in Antarctic temperatures very closely and is staggered by a few hundred years at most,” explains Sune Olander Rasmussen, Associate Professor and centre coordinator at the Centre for Ice and Climate at the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen."
