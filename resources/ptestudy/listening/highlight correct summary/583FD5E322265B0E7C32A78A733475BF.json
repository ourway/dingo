      "The speaker tells us that clichÃ©s are the enemy of literature and art. They are words, phrases and images that have become stale through overuse and therefore have nothing new to say to us. They are an enemy to clear and original thinking, although they are sometimes useful in advertising to get a simple message across.",
      "While clichÃ©s in writing reveal lazy thinking and are to be avoided at all costs, in the graphic arts they become essential, helping to get the message across quickly, clearly and with emotional force. This is especially true of advertising and propaganda where the impact must be immediate.",
      "ClichÃ©s are worn out, overused and over-familiar phrases, and the etymology of the word helps to explain this. Originally, a clichÃ© or stereotype was a printer’s term for a pre-set block of type with phrases used frequently in the newspapers. The word has since adopted a negative meaning and careful writers avoid them where they can."

    "text": "A clichÃ©, as you know, is an overused and worn out phrase â and … um … these are to be avoided like the plague in your essays. Indeed, someone once said, I quote, “there is no greater danger to either education or thinking than the popular phrase”. Let me digress a little further; originally a cliche was a printer’s term, back in the days when letters were set one by one, for a ready-made block of type of frequently used phrases, usually in the newspaper business. So … there you are … urn … clichÃ©s were also known as stereotypes. Now, if you think of graphic design as a language with its own vocabulary, grammar, and so on, it too must have its clichÃ©s. Obvious examples would be, urn, the twin Greek masks of comedy and tragedy that symbolize the theater and, more popularly known, the heart as a symbol of love, especially on Valentine cards, and so on. Far from being a terrible fault – as it would be in literature – the visual clichÃ© is essential in the world of graphic communication. This is certainly true when it comes to advertising and propaganda. The visual clichÃ© can give immediate life to an idea and a clear meaning to what could be a mere abstraction."
