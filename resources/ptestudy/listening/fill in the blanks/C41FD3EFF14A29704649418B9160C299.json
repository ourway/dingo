    "text": "For millions of years, carbon dioxide levels in theatmosphere have been regulated, in part, by a natural partnership  between plants and microbes â€“ tiny organisms in the soil. Plants absorb CO2 from the air and transform  it into sugars and other carbon-based substances. While a proportion  of these carbon products remain in the plant, some transfer from the roots to fungi and soil microbes, which store the carbon in the soil."
