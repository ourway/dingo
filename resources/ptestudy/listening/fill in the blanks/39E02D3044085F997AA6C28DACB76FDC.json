    "text": "The eyes are the windows to the soul. As such they canreveal if someone is lying, right? Cop shows, advice shows, even someorganizational training courses hold that if somebody looks up and to the right, they’re probably lying. Up and to the left means they’re telling the truth. Now a study says that there is no  connection between eye movement and lying. The work is in the journal Public Library of Science ONE. Researchers tested eye movement and honesty in multiple ways. For example, they tracked the eye movements of subjects who were lying or telling the truth about things they had recently done. There was nocorrelation between lying and eye direction. The researchers also closely analyzed 52 archived news videos of real people, making a public plea for the safe return of a missingrelative In half the videos the plea was sincere—but in half there was strong evidence that the speaker was involved in the crime. Again, no eye movement clue was evident So when judging the honesty of a speaker, remember: the eyes do not have it."
