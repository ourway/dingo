    "text": "Cities are interesting places. Some cities are carefully planned for a reason and reflecting needs of the people as it grows. Others are less conscientiously designed. Paris, for example, was originally founded in the third century as a small village and with every passing generation, it grew in size and importance. It grew from a medieval city to a modern city but the transition was not always smooth. Empire Napoleon the third had to hire someone to oversee the rebuilding of Paris. The man he chose was Georges-Eugène Haussmann. In 1853 Haussmann began the process of renovating France’s capital city. His basic instructions were to bring light and air into the central districts, improve the sanitation and living areas, and make Paris a more modern beautiful city, not your average weekend renovation. Haussmann’s projects included the destruction of the old medieval neighborhoods, widening of streets, building large parks and public squares and addition of fountains and sewer lines. To add all of this the size of Paris had to be increased, doubled actually, and Napoleon the third issued official decrees annexing nearby suburbs to make them part of the city. One of the main priorities of this massive renovation was to connect all of the districts together"
