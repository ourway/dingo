    "text": "Jupiter has 2-1/2 times more mass as compared to all other planets put together. Besides, its diameter is 11 times more than Earth’s diameter. Because of its size, the scientists were also forced into believing that it became a star. Gasses and dust contracted to build the planet and immense pressure was created by the gravitational forces along with tens of thousands of degrees of temperature. However, unlike the Sun, the unavailability of sufficient mass required to create the temperature which can initiate fusion reaction, Jupiter relatively got cooler over a period of time."
