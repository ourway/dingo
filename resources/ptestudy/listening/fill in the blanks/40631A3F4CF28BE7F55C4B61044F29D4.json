    "text": "China will become the world’s safest and largestinvestment economy in times to come given the following factors: huge market potential , rich labor resources, comparative advantage in labor cost, sound corporate governance and  stable government and society. All these factors will further attract the inflow of foreign capital into China. In short, China’s economy will grow even faster in the future. In the next 15 years, China’s economy will still increase at a rate 7%-8%. In year 2020, should price index remain the same as today, GDP will  amount to US $4.8 trillion, GDP per capita per capita will reach US $3,300. However, the level of GDP per capita is still very low in China at the moment, GDP per capita’s growth is still at a slow rate. GDP per capita will have to be furtherincreased in order to raise China’s standard of living so as to bridge the present income gap between the rich and the poor. Satisfaction of consumers’ needs can be the main driver in raising China’s living standards. Domestic demand will increase as the economy grows. Therefore extensive production of goods and services can further push and sustain the economy’s growth. Moreover, there are abundant human resources in China, and labor cost in China is much lower than the other industrialized countries. China’s education system is also being fast developed, thus more people will achieve higher level of education than in the past. With comparative advantage in cheap labor cost and increase of human capital brought about by education, future for China’s economy can be only even brighter."
