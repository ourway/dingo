    "text": "A sustainable transportation system is one in which people’s needs and desires for access to jobs, commerce, recreation, culture and home are accommodated using a minimum of resources. Applying  principles  of  sustainability to transportation will reduce pollution generated by gasoline-powered engines, noise, traffic congestion, land devaluation, urban sprawl, economic segregation, and injury to drivers, pedestrians and cyclists. In addition, the costs of commuting, shipping, housing and goods will be reduced . Ultimately in a sustainable San Francisco, almost all trips to and  within the City will be on public transit, foot or bicycle — as will a good part of trips to the larger Bay Region. Walking through streets designed for pedestrians and bicycles will be more pleasant than walking through those designed for the automobile. Street-front retail and commercial establishments will prosper from the large volume of foot traffic drawn to an environment enhanced by trees, appropriately designed “street furniture,” (street lights, bicycle racks, benches, and the like) and other people. Rents and property costs will be lowered as land for off-street parking is no longer  required or needed."
