Your body is also where 10 times that number of bacteria call home sweet home. But don’t be afraid-these bacteria do more good than harm to you.And besides, just in case youwanted to strike up a conversation with your tenants, you and your bacteria do have a few things in common. All cells share some common characteristics that make them living things. All organisms are composed of cells, the basic fundamental unit of life. They contain DNA as a heritable genetic material, and they can reproduce. They transcribe DNA into RNA and translate RNA into proteins on ribosomes. They can also regulate transport across a cell membrane and require chemical energy for some cellular processes. Organelles are the biggest difference between bacteria and cells that make up the human body Organelles"
