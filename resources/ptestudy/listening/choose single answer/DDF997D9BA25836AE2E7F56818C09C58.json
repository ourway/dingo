    "text": "Hi. Today I am here to talk about laughter, a very interesting thing which happens naturally, and I just wonder and start by thinking about the first time I can ever remember noticing laughter and how it felt. That was when I was a little girl. I would’ve been about 6 years old. I came across my parents doing something unusual, actually they were laughing. They were laughing very, very hard. They were rolling on the floor and laughing. They were blaring with laughter. I did not know what they were laughing at, but I wanted to be in that situation. I wanted to be part of that, and I sat on the ground round at the edge going, “Ha, Ha, ha!” . Now people were laughing at a song which people used to resonate happily, which is dependent around things like signs in toilets on trains telling you what you could and could not do in toilets on trains. And the thing you have to memorize about the English is, of course, we do have a hugely complicated sense of funniness."
