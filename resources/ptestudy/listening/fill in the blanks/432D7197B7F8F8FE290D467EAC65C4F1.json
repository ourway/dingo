    "text": "This week we’re going to be continuing our discussion of women in society. Last week we looked at a number of issues relating to women in education. If you remember, we discussed women both at school and at university. Today we’re going to be considering the roles that women play in the workplace. Again, we’ll start by taking a historical perspective, and inevitably you’ll find that many of the same  events that impacted on women in education also had a major influence on their working lives. In the second half of the lecture, I’ll concentrate on the situation in Europetoday, and I’ll invite you to suggest how you think things are likely to develop over the next decade.OK, so let’s get started."
