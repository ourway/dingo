    "text": "most of what the general public knows about daily life in ancient Rome comes from art, architecture and literature, which tell us more about the elites, especially the goings-on of the Empress, but how much do we know of the lives of ordinary Romans. did they have a voice, apart, but is from what we can gather from graffiti. The usual picture is one of time spent at festivals, paths, and typically the games. However, the many Romans terrible living conditions, poverty, debt and the chance of being sold into slavery at any moment. That is if they want slaves already, left no time or energy for such forms of entertainment or for any interest in politics for that matter. Indeed, after the death of Augustus, executive power was taken from the elected assemblies of the Roman people. Now it was the emperor’s job to look after the people, and his generosity often depended on the mood and behavior of the people, on how often and how violently they protested and rioted. One example would be Clausius ensuring a steady grain supply, even in winter, after rioters pelted him with stale crusts of bread. There is an anecdote about, umm, Hadrian. While touring the provinces, an old lady approached him with a complaint; he made excuses and tried to get away. She said that if he wouldn’t give her a hearing, he shouldn’t be Emperor. She got her hearing."
