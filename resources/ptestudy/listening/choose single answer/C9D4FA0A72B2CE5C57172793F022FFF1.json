    "text": "Listen to a discussion in the business class. The computerized workplace can be hazardous to your health. If you don’t take preventative measures. today will go over what some of these hazards are, and more importantly what can be done about them. One major complaint may be the biggest complaint of people who spend time at the computer is eyestrain to help ease the strain on the eyes. The computer screen should be about 2 feet from your eyes the entire screen should be in focus, the brightness and contrast should be adjusted for best readability. A good way to relieve eyestrain is to look away from the screen frequently focus your eyes on objects that are far away like something outside the building across the street or the tree in the parking lot. What if your office doesn’t have a window? I mean, I reckon. Lots of places where there’s no window, then in that case, you need to get up and walk around. You should never sit for more than 30 minutes at a time anyway. This is important for the rest of your body as well, namely her back, neck and back pain are a big problem for computer people. always make sure your screen, keyboard and chair are at the right height for you."
