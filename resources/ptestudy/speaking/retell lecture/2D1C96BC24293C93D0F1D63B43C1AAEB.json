    "text": "As physicists try to explain the masses particles, they found that if they just tried to inject the mass into the mathematical equations in a most straight -forward way, just put a parameter for the massive particles right into the math, the math didn’t work. It gave rise to quantum mechanically inconsistent features, so it’s recognized you need to have a more subtle way of introducing mass into the equations. That would not spoil the fundamental symmetries, but yet would allow the particles to have different masses, you see, fundamentally, the idea is that all particles begin life has been massless. There’s a high degree of symmetry associated with it, all the particles have the same mass is zero. How do you inject math without spoiling that symmetry which is vital for the equations to make sense. The Higgs field does that by immersing everything in this bath, this molasses-like bath, it turns out that the equations allow you to have you cake and eat it. The fundamental symmetries are deeply preserved and yet the way in which the particles move experiencing different resistance like drag force allows them to have different masses."
