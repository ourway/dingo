    "text": "At last month’s meeting, you asked me to draw up a report about the possibility of keeping the student center open twenty-four hours a day. I decided that the best way to assess the need for expanded hours was to talk to the people who were still in the student center at closing time. First, over the course of the two weeks, I interviewed more than fifty students as they left the student center at its regular closing time of twelve midnight. About eighty percent of them said they would prefer that the center stay open later. Of the three main uses of the center -eating in the snack bar, recreation in the game room or watching TV, and studying by far the most popular late night activity is-and this may surprise you-studying .Almost all of the people I talked to said that their main reason for being in the center after ten p.m. was to study in groups or to find a quiet place to study because their dorm was too noisy. Of course, many of these people used the snack bar or TV room for breaks. My recommendation is that we ask the administration to keep the center open after midnight for studying. The recreation room and snack bar can still close at the usual time. This should meet the objection that it costs too much to staff the center from midnight to eight a.m., which I’m sure will be the first response."
