Research is more advanced in animals, but experiments on humans are hard. Yet, even today, some parts of the brain, like the motor cortex, are better understood. Nor is complete knowledge always needed. Machine learning can recognize patterns of neural activity; the brain itself gets the hang of controlling BCIS with extraordinary ease. And neuroethology will reveal more of the brainâ€™s secrets"
