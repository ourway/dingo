    "text": "Today I would like to talk about a book in this class. This book focuses on architecture design in London. Not just any place in London. It is in the west side of London cold West Street of London. The architecture made a very poor design of the buildings there. This can cause a moon swing. An awful design of the building can have a negative influence on peopleâ€™s mood. If you want some beautiful designs then you must visit Stanford and Frankfurt. They are good examples of the best architectural designs. Different architects have different perspectives on beauty, which is an arrogant word since is in the eye of the beholder. One can write the Bible cracked out in the play, but how one can design bad and ugly buildings. Well, it is difficult for architects to realize a bad architectural design."
