But Finnin’s research, commissioned by a cosmetics company, is unlikely to be published in a scientific newspaperjournalgazettesmagazinesjournal. It’s hard to even find studies that show the active ingredients in cosmetics penetrate the skin, let alone more comprehensive research on their effects. Even when vigorousrigorousstrenuousstrongrigorousstudies are commissioned, companies usually control whether the work is published in the traditional scientific literature."
