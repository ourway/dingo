    "text": "Asteroid collisions can be destructive– just ask the dinosaurs – but they also bring keyingredientsfor life. Super-Earths can draw them to nearby worlds. Super-Earths – planets that are up to 10 times more massive than Earth — might playbilliardswith planetary systems. New simulations suggest that if a super-Earth existed in our own solar system, say between Venus and the Earth, far more asteroids would collidewith us. But that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, if the timing is right. Understanding the effect of these massive planets on others nearby could help direct the search for life on exoplanets."
