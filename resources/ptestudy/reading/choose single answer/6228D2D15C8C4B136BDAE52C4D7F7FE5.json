    "text": "The bunyip is a large creature from Australian aboriginal mythology, which is believed to live in swamps, billabongs and riverbeds. Although the tales of the Bunyip specifically have been traced back to the Wemba-Wemba people of south-eastern Australian, aboriginal peoples across Australia have beliefs and stories synonymous to the Bunyip. Descriptions of Bunyips vary considerably, with some sources describing it as a giant starfish, others with a dog-like face, dark fur, a horse like tail, horns, flippers or a ducks bill. The size of the Bunyip also varies depending on the origin of the myth, but some accounts state the Bunyip to be as much as twelve or thirteen feet tall. Academics have sought to explain the origins of the Bunyip myth, and palaeontologists suggest that the Bunyip may be a cultural memory of extinct mega fauna, such as the Giant wombat or marsupial lion. Today, the Bunyip remains an important part of Australian aboriginal folklore and is a frequently discussed topic in cryptozoology circles."
