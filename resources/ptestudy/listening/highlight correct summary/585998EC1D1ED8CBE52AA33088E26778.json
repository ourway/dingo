      "There are fewer Great White sharks in Australian waters than was once believed. This is because tagging has shown that sharks travel considerable distances, and a shark recorded east of Bass Strait one week is often recorded west of Bass Strait the next. However, sharks always return to their place of origin to breed.",
      "A recent research study has shown that Australian Great White shark populations have remained surprisingly distinct as, despite traveling long distances, these sharks do not breed away from their original areas. This means that local shark habitats may have a greater effect on sharks than has been believed up to now.",
      "There is a greater variety in the Great White shark populations in Australian waters than was previously thought to be the case. This means that some types of shark are actually more endangered than was believed. Scientists are therefore developing conservation programs which will help to protect these threatened species.",
      "An investigation of Great White sharks in Australian waters has come up with some unexpected conclusions, as it found that the genetic make-up of sharks in one area was quite distinct from those found elsewhere. This made scientists realize that sharks do not swim as far away from their home areas as used to be thought."

    "text": "A new investigation into shark populations in the waters off Australia has discovered that there are two distinct species of Great White shark, one to the east and one to the west of Bass Strait. This was discovered by tagging large numbers of sharks in the coastal waters all round Australia. Rather to the investigatorsâ€™ surprise, they found that while sharks from the east side certainly travelled to the west side of the continent and vice versa, they always returned to their home areas to breed. The two types of shark were found to have a distinct genetic make-up, indicating that interbreeding has not taken place. The implication of these research findings is that sharks may be more susceptible to changes in local marine environments than had previously been thought."
