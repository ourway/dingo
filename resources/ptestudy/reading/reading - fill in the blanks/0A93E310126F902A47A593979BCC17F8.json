    "text": "Snails are not traditionally known for quick thinking, but new research shows they can make complex decisions using just two brain cells in  findings  that could help engineers design more efficient robots. Scientists at the University of Sussex attached electrodes to the  heads  of freshwater snails as they searched for lettuce. They found that just one cell was used by the mollusk to tell if it was  hungry  or not, while another let it know when food was present. Food-searching is an example of goal-directed  behavior  , during which an animal must integrate information about both its external environment and internal state while using as little energy as possible. Lead researcher Professor George Kemenes, said: “This will eventually help us design the “brains” of robots based on the principle of using the fewest possible components necessary to  perform  complex tasks. “What goes on in our brains when we make complex behavioral decisions and carry them out  is  poorly  understood. “Our study reveals for the first time how just two neurons can create a mechanism  in an animal’s brain which drives and optimizes complex decision-making tasks."
