    "text": "What looks, swims, and acts like a sea snake but isnâ€™t a sea snake? The mimic octopus, of course! This really cool creature pretends to be other animals as a form of protection. Octopuses have always been known as masters of disguise, changing color to blend in with their surroundings. What makes the mimic octopus unusual is its ability to use shape as well as color to mimic other animals. This octopus makes itself look like poisonous sea creatures, including certain fish and sea snakes. Scientists think that the mimic octopus chooses which animal to imitate depending on which predator is nearby."
