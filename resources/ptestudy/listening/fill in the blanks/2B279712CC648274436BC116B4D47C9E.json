    "text": "The notion of establishing an international coalition to fightstarvation was proposed by president Johannes of Germany on World Food Day in 2001. He proposed forming an international coalition to solve political and other problems that  obstruct  raising enough funds to fight starvation and poverty. The proposal received the support from a large number of people. Five years later, in the World Grain Summit Conference, attendants decided to amend the manifesto to “International Eradicate Starvation Coalition”. Many people hope the coalition can be supported, so that a resolution will be forged and plans made to eliminate starvation and poverty. In 2002, during the Development Fund Raising Conference held in Monterrey, Mexico, the Grain and Agricultural Organization, International Agricultural Development Fund and World Grain Plan Department made a joint appeal for poverty elimination. They also expressed dissatisfaction that governments and development partnersdidn’t turn their promise into a detailed action plan, so there is much to bedesired  . At the Monterrey conference, many countries promised to increase official development aid. European Coalition countries agreed to raise the $official development aid to 0.39% of the state income from 2006. The US also announced it will increase development assistance by 5 billion US dollars in three years. The Coalition will also keeppressure on each country to force them to honor their promises by exposing the difficult situation faced by people in starvation and poverty to the public."
