    "text": "The Wrights dated the origin of their interest in flight to 1878, when their father had presented them with a toy helicopter. News accounts of the death of the German gliding pioneer Otto Lilienthal in an August 1896 glider crash reawakened their interest and led to a search for trustworthy information on aeronautics.  There are three important elements in designing an aircraft. The first two are wings and structure, which have been well developed. It is a control system that Wright brothers have realized that is essential to achieve a successful flight. But such formidable problem has been solved and makes them a breakthrough.  Wright brothers are flying around the Statue of Liberty then up the Hudson River to Grantâ€™s Tomb and back. Over a million Americans see this fly and they became the celebrity."
