    "text": "We don’t have any databases on this sort of information. As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact that people vary in theirperceptions  of noise-so someone like me with years of working in acoustics  might be very different from you in that regard. But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly crude  they’ve been useful in providing information and raising awareness . that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so it’s a political matter. And that’s important-we need rules and  regulations . because noise can cause all sort of problems. Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day."
