Well-being is not something that is purely limited to people who are facing extraordinary challenges in their lifestyle, health or personal circumstances, everybody here has a level of well-being. Music so often forms an intuitive part of our well-being management, music to pick us up, music to calm us down, music to heal our sorrow. Our aim through research is to move from this level of intuitive application of music through to informed use in our communities to take the next step in the understanding of the power of music in human life. Music already works for us on so many levels whether itâ€™s soothing and teaching our infants bringing people and communities together spirit to our work and personal endeavors, but there is no reason to stop her."
