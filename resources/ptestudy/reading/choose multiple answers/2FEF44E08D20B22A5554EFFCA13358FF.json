    "text": "We require good sleep to restore brain chemicals and to provide rest necessary to the body. According to few researchers and medical practitioners, during slumber the brain organizes and stores memories. Lack of proper sleep affects our hormonal balance, appetite, daytime functioning and immune system. Good sleep is uninterrupted and restful which is not the case with a fitful sleep. Your muscles are relaxed during a good sleep. It also helps your body rearrange once or twice during each hour of sleep so that blood circulates properly. Babies need to sleep for about 16 hours a day while children need about 9-16 hours of sleep. Teenage children require 9 hours of sleep and adults about 7-8 hours of sleep. If you donâ€™t sleep better, you have a difficult time concentrating on key tasks and remain inactive and feel fatigued during daytime which affects your overall performance in a bad way. Frequent mood swings and irritation affects your routine life as well."
