Now the power that the turbine creates is obviously depended on the wind speed, it also depended obviously on the number of sails, the area of the sails and the angle of the sails makes to the wind. So you can imagine if the turbine blades flat onto the wind, the wind is going to just bend it, if there is slight angle when the wind hits it, it’s going to turn the blades. We can use that for powering things. Now, we’re going to have a go, making some of the very, very simple paper windmills, a sort of things that you can make from the bits and pieces lying around home, and use that to drive very small generator to power electronic devices."
