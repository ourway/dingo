    "text": "This is the first of the Huston film lectures â a series of lectures from the National University of Ireland’s Huston School of Film and Digital Media in Galway. The lecture series features leading film directors, writers, producers, cinematographers and academics. In this lecture, Irish Feminist film maker Pat Murphy looks at what are the influences on her as a film maker â the people, the events, the ideas and the context that has influenced her work. Pat Murphy grew up in Northern Ireland and studied in London at the Hornsey College of Arts and the Royal College of Arts in the 1970s. Here films Maeve, Anne Devlin and in 2001 Nora starring Susan Lynch and Ewan McGregor have made her one of Ireland’s most important film makers."
