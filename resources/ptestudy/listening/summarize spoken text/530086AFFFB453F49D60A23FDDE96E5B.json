    "text": "So really when you talk about using science to solve problems which I think most about pseudoscience. We of course want to understand the world but at the end of the day we want to change the world. We always have an impact really to heart problems. And the two that CBA and focuses on are actually water purification and how to make clean water which is actually a huge issue for all of us. And in fact really intersects with the second aspect of CBN which is health human health. How do we improve human health across the world. Those two areas those two social drivers are the things that all of the faculty in the U.N. are working towards in their individual and collaborative research. And the ones that I’ll be focusing on today is this problem of water will be taken granted entry before it now to provide bottled water. We can get it right out of the tap whether we’ll be able to do that in 10 years as the cost of energy rises is an interesting question. And certainly if you’re not fortunate enough to live in the developed. World you won’t find radioactive water around the corner. So this particular issue is one that is a big global problem and one that new technologies are well suited to address and nanotechnology is one of the most promising and exciting areas to turn to for finding solutions to problems."
