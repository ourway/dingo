    "text": "There’s little doubt the young Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete was primed for leadership, having spent his childhood with his grandfather, a local chief, before following his father, also a public servant, to outposts across Tanzania. Rising quickly up the political ladder, the future president became one of the youngest ministers in Tanzanian history when he took the reins of the Finance Ministry. He then served 10 years as Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. Mr. Kikwete’s international influence did not go unnoticed, as he was the first African leader to meet President Barack Obama in 2009.Domestically, the Kikwete presidency has been a turning point for Tanzania. “The major key behind all this is the pursuit of sound economic policies, as we make sure that the macroeconomic frame remains of the right track,” the former president says. The country’s infrastructure has seen the most visible change over the past decade. Michael Mhando, Acting Director General at the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF), celebrates the improvement in health infrastructures. “Anti-poverty strategies are now in place to ensure the poor have access to health care services,” he says.With yet a long road ahead, the country seems on the right track towards making that vision a reality."
