A middle layer of nickel, which gives the bots magnetic polarity, so they can be pulled through wastewater with magnets. And platinum inside- for propulsion. Just add a bit of peroxide to the wastewater, and itâ€™ll react with the platinum to form water and oxygen bubbles, which propel the tubes along."
