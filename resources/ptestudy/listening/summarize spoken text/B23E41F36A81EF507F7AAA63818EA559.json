    "text": "Today I would like to focus on some of the important features of academic writing. The quality is the first most aspect of any writing, when you write about history, you need have the same qualities as general writing. They are both similar. When you are writing academic and general papers you might consider some of these factors. Both require resource and evidences as one is writing style. Furthermore, the attention of logic in writing is also important. One thing that puzzles me is that there is no can a connection between history and general writing, but somehow they are so much alike."
