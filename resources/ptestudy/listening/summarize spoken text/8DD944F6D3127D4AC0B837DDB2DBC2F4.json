    "text": "Every human in culture we know the music and language, these are universe, genuine human universe when they go way back in our specie’s history. So the question what these two things might have been common has occurred a lot of people when it’s two of them both involve complex sequences that afford in time both forms in communication, it’s interesting, philosophers since Plato going back over 2000 years, scientists including Darwin who wrote about possible evolutionary links between music and language in his book “The Descent of Man”, an artist including Leonard Bernstein who gave a set of lectures Harvard in the 70s about possible connections between the grammar of music and the grammar of language according to Noam Chamsky theories.  So it’s a persist question and I think it continuously at from scientists today, because they are just in basic obvious similarities. For example, both music and language have rhythm by which I mean systematic patterns of timing, accent and grouping. They both have melody, meaning structure patterns of pitch over time. And they both have syntax, mean … elements like notes, words and principles where combining those elements of sequence sentences are just random sequences verbs, music is nowadays compositions of far from random sequences of notes, their principles. And they both convey emotion or affect using sound, you can tell somebody’s emotions … their voices, you can get a lot of emotional information about music is conveying happiness, sadness or mixed emotions …happy."
