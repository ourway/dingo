    "text": "Bejing often suffers choking air. But there’s now one more thing provento dissipate it: an Olympics. The 2008 summer games impelled those in charge of the Chinese capitalto clear the air. Not only did they banish smog and smoke, they also inadvertently cut greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 96,000 metric tons during the games. That’s according to a new analysis published in Geophysical Research Letters on July 20th. The key was banning half of all the private cars in the city from driving on any particular day during the event. The finding suggests that individual choices like whether to drive or take public transit to work have major cumulativeeffects. London’s so-called congestioncharge for driving in town likewise cuts traffic and pollution. This year, London is bidding to have the most environmentally friendly Olympics ever. That includes building new stadiums atop former industrial sites and urging fans to choose public transit, walking or cycling. But the British may not match the Chinese achievementor even attempt to make the London games carbon neutral. The Olympics that finally achieves zero carbon would really merit a gold, for green."
