    "text": "Welcome to Yellowstone National Park. Before we begin our nature walk today, I’d like to give you a short history of our National Park Service. The National Park Service began in the late 1800’s. A small group of explorers had just completed a month-long exploration of the region that is now Yellowstone. They gathered around a campfire, and after hours of discussion, they decided that they should not claim this land for themselves. They felt it should be accessible to everyone. So they began a campaign to preserve this land for everyone’s enjoyment . Two years later, in the late nineteenth century, an act of Congress signed by President Ulysses S. Grant proclaimed the Yellowstone region a public park. It was the first national park in the world. After Yellowstone became a public park, many other areas of great scenic importance were set aside, and in 1916 the National Park Service was established to manage these parks. As a park ranger, I am an employee of the National Park Service. In a national park, park rangers are on duty at all times to answer questions and help visitors in any difficulty. Nature walks, guided tours , and campfire talks are offered by specially training staff members. The park service also protects the animals and plants within the parks."
