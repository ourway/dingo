    "text": "Coca-Cola has bucked the trend for celebrity-fronted advertising by choosing a  virtually unknown British artist to front one of its biggest UK campaigns. While arch-rival Pepsi features the likes of David Beckham and Beyonce Knowles in its campaigns, Coca-Cola has hired the Basement Jaxx vocalist Sharlene Hector to star in its first ever UK branding campaign for Coca-Cola Classic. The advertbreaks tomorrow and features Hector singing the Nina Simone Classic I Wish as she walks through the streets distributing bottles of Coca-Cola. It is the latest in the company’s new “Real” campaign , which took over from the “Always Coca-Cola” adverts and is aimed at giving the brand a more irreverent image — the actress Penelope Cruz has appeared  belching after drinking Coke in adverts in the US. The new advertising is the first campaign to be created by the quirky British advertising agency Mother, which won the Coca-Cola business last year after  pitching against the company’s longstanding US agency, McCann-Erickson. The agency had already created campaign for Coca-Cola owned createdLilt, Oasis and Schweppes, and was charged with coming up with a specifically British  approach to the world’s best-known brand. The strategy  is part of the Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive Douglas Daft’s so-called “Think local, act local” philosophy , inspired by the realization that what works for American consumers will not necessarily succeed elsewhere."
