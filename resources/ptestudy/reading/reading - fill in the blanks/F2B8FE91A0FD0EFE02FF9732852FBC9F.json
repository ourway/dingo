    "text": "Bees and flowers have evolved together for millions of years. It is a mutual relationship where the bee is provided with food (nectar or pollen) and the stationary plant gets to  disperse  its pollen (sperm cells) to other plants of the same species. For the plant this is much more  efficient  than using wind to disperse its pollen. Consequently, over millions of years plants have developed flowers with increasingly specialized features to attract visiting bees who, in turn, would distribute pollen grains and optimize the plantâ€™s reproductive capabilities. Simultaneously, bees underwent physiological, behavioral and structural adaptations to take advantage of the nutritional benefits offered by flowering plants. This is an example of a  co-evolutionary  relationship."
