    "text": "Viatamin E supplementation confirmed as a treatment for liver problems. Hi, Iâ€™m Doctor James Meschino. There is a common fatty liver condition known as NASH. That is commonly seen in diabetics, pre-diabetics and people who are overweight. NASH stands for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, a condition where you have an inflamed liver that is not caused by alcohol consumption. It is caused b faulty lifestyle behaviors, lots of fat in the diet in particular. Of course, alcohol consumption can also induce fatty liver problems. But with the obesity epidemic that we have at hand, more and more people are developing fatty liver disease, not from alcohol but from faulty dietary lifestyle patterns and lack of exercise. If it is left unchecked, fatty liver problems can degenerate into cirrhosis. In cirrhosis of the liver, you are getting scar tissue and fibrotic tissue. Nodules start to replace normal liver tissue. With advancing cirrhosis, you can end up with liver failure, requiring a liver transplant. Cirrhosis is the tenth leading cause of death in men in our society. It is the twelfth leading cause of death in women in our society as of 2001. In 2012, new medical guidelines were issued for the management of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. One of the major recommendations was 800 IUs of vitamin E every day. Why? Well, vitamin E is one of the few agents that has been shown to actually reverse some of the liver damage in people that have this problem. Other studies have also shown recently that vitamin E is linked to prevention of liver cancer in people who are high risk for primary liver cancer. Primary liver cancer is known as hepatocellular carcinoma."
