Just to say he sort of sucks up knowledge across a wide range of fields. He is not an academic. He has a consulting company which he runs off until he recently out of his home in Colorado. He is inside snow mass in a house built in two of the sides of the mountain that has no furnace. For that thirty years, he has been kind of iconic plastic oddball genius, thinking up ways to save energy thinking of ways to solve problems using technology that already exists, and he has demonstrated several of them. He also offers, he is something that, he is such an oddball that people tend to think he is kind of crazy. Anyway, Elizabeth Callbirth went and spent some time with Amory Lovins, and so he has written this piece called Mr. Green."
