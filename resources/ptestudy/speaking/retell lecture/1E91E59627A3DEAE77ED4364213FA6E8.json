    "text": "All we’re trying to do when we build robots is to get those skills and perceptions and mechanical designs into machines, into robots. I think our long-term goal is to do this. To build robots that have the functional levels of performance. That are equal to, or greater, than people and animals. I don’t mean that they have to work the way people animals work or that they have to look like them just at the level of performance in terms of mobility the ability to move around in the world . Dexterity the ability to use our hands. Look I’m handling this device. I can rotate it around. I’m sensing there’s a remarkable amount going on that we make seem so easy. And then perception. I mean here’s a room with two hundred people just within this theater and I can look and see every one of you. I can do it while I’m moving. It’s totally remarkable. Yet, we can all do it and we don’t think about it. We didn’t have to be specially trained. Yet, those are the skills that we’re trying to put into our robots."
