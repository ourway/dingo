    "text": "And I’m a professor of children’s literature at Newcastle University. And I wanted to write A Very Short Introduction to children’s literature, because although here in Britain we have one of the longest and most distinguished traditions of creating books for children, perhaps they will give some in the world.  We often take them for granted and we don’t pay enough attention to what a remarkable cultural resource they are for adults and the kind of cultural work they do for children, and the way that they serve writers and Illustrators and cultural space for creativity the provision and opportunity to experiment with new ideas. And what kind of cultural works the children’s books do? Well at the level of an individual child, this is one of the places where children learn the vocabulary, getting vicarious experiences, and see the images of the world that helps them think about how the world works, and where they fit into it. Because children’s books are one of the first places that children encounter these things that often scary west get a source of information about particular period things , including what it thinks a child is what a child needs to know what childhood looks like. Sometimes when we’re looking at children’s books from the past it’s very important to notice the kinds of children that are there, for instance. So that’s one of the things that we have in children’s books the great repository of stories that have been shaped for children in the past, that tell us about the values of the past. And the kinds of struggles sometimes the children’s minds, that have gone on at the decisive moment in history."
