    "text": "Let’s look at this video of these little kids they were offered the option having one marshmallow immediately now and two marshmallow 15 minutes later and you’ve got some very cute videotape of this experiment so let’s take a look, okay.  What we found is very simple and direct way of measuring a competence that seems to make an important life difference. A researcher tell these preschoolers that she’s going to leave the room if they wait for her comeback without eating the marshmallow they’ll get two marshmallow or they can ring the ball and she’ll right away but then they get one marshmallow.  You won’t ring the bell, okay?  Looking at children over time Dr. Michele has found that being able to wait longer at 4:00 has some powerful implications.  And what are those powerful implications is that later in life they’re more discipline and have more self-control is that pretty much it. Well are more likely to achieve their life goals, they have better relationships they did better on their SATs.  Crazy all, because they waited 15 minutes for 2 marshmallow?  I mean I think it is crazy I probably would have eaten all three.  Yeah me too.  But you know actually yes the ability to be able to pursue your goals in this case that was stabbed 2 marshmallows versus one and not going automatic and just grab the marshmallow is a very important skill but I think the main point in my mind in the making is that these skill can be caught taught if you’re 14 or 40 or 4 it’s not ever to late and may child can learn them any adult can teach them in it’s never too late."
