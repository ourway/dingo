    "text": "Well, the Voynich manuscript does have many different theories proposed for it .some people think that it’s a complete hoax, it’s now been carbon dated from the 15th century. so it’s most likely if it is hopes to have been a 15th century hoax which I personally don’t believe, but some people think it’s just gobbledygook it’s just an invention to make money, somebody made it to fool people and make money other people think it’s probably a code in other words someone encoded lots of secrets in it hoping that no one would find out and if so that’s been very successful because no one’s corrector so far. But in my opinion it is actually a genuine script obviously a human devised script, but masking behind it a genuine human language. In a language it seems to me to have more if you like Near Eastern maybe Caucasian Asian aspects to it rather than European, because of some of the words that I’ve decoded. So I would imagine that once we’ve actually managed to decode the script will find that the language underneath is a natural human language probably from that part of the world."
