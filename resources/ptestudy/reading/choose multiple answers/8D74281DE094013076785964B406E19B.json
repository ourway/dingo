    "text": "Adolescence is basically the transition from childhood to adulthood. Literally the term ‘adolescent’ means ‘becoming adult’. While we can see all stages in the life course as being transitional in some respect (that is, they bridge the gap between the previous and the forthcoming stages), adolescence is a particularly important transition because it entails developing a significantly different outlook on life, moving from the perspective of a child to that of an adult with all the responsibility that this entails. It can be a stressful and demanding time, but it does not have to be. Indeed, we should beware of the stereotype that all adolescents go through a period of ‘storm and stress’, as if adolescence is necessarily a time of strain. Similarly, we should not fall into the trap of adopting a stereotype of the adolescent as being rebellious. While there are indeed many examples of rebellious behaviour by adolescents, there are also a significant proportion of adolescents who do not engage in anything approaching rebellious behaviour (and many people who do engage in rebellious behaviour who are not adolescent). In fact, we can see that the majority of adolescents are highly conformist when we look at the situation without the distorting lens of a stereotype."
