    "text": "You might picture Neanderthals as cavemen gnawing on bones around a campfire. Which wouldn’t be inaccurate  But Neanderthals may have also dined on roasted vegetables and known a bit about medicinal plants too. So says a study in the journal Naturwissenschaften (The Science of Nature) . Researchers analyzed hardened dental plaque from five Neanderthals found in El Sidrón cave, in northern Spain. Yes, 50,000-year-old dental plaque. And they found a lot lurking between the teeth. Like evidence of nuts, grasses and green veggies, chemical traces of wood smoke, and tiny, intact starch granules, proof Neanderthals ate their carbs. And in one individual, they detected compounds found in the medicinalherbs chamomile and yarrow. The herbs have no nutritional value, and since Neanderthals did have the gene to detect the herbs’ bitter taste, the researchers speculatethat the cave dwellers were munching on them not as food—but to self-medicate. Not too far-fetched, they say, because primates like chimps also use medicinal plants. Luckily for the scientists doing this detective work, Neanderthals may have known a thing or two about medicine, but they didn’t get regular check-ups at the dentist."
