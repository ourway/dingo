    "text": "So how was this reflected in the design of the building? Well, Harrison decided to createpedestrian  access to the building and to make use of the presence  of water on the site. As people approach the entrance  they therefore have to cross over a bridge. He wanted to give people a feeling of suspense  as they see the building first from a distance, and then close-up, and the initial impression  he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a box."
