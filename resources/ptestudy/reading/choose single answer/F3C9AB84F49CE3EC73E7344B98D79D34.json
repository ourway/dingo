    "text": "Rightly is they called pigs, said Rowley, a farm laborer looking at the wallowing animals before passingon to the cow sheds, in Aldous Huxley’s novel Chrome Yellow. Those who heard his words commentedon his wisdom.This raises all sorts of questions about language and how we perceive the world, questions that rangefrom the philosophical to the politically correct (PC) use of language and the question of causing offence- for example, calling someone a pig.Those who believed in being PC tried to adjust language to take into account people’s sensitivities in theareas of race, sexuality and disability, and a theologian has recently written that we should do the samefor the animal kingdom. To call them wild or beasts is, he says, derogatory and offensive. I’m allin favor of animal welfare, but, in arguing his case, he says that language is the means by which weunderstand and conceptualize the world around us.But is it? Isn’t it the other way round? To put it another, very simple, way: do you believe that thelanguage you use has made you think of the world in a certain way, or that you have an idea of theworld as it is and your place in it, and you use language to understand and describe it?Is Rowley’s wisdom based on his many years working with farm animals, and what he has seen is justpigs being pigs and there’s nothing more to be said? Or has he decided that the name pig suits thesecreatures because they behave piggishly? If we cleaned them up, taught them table manners and madethem wear a tie, would we have to call them something else?"
