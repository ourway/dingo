    "text": "Privacy and the right to privacy are increasingly becoming hot topics in the media, which is a touch ironic , given that it is often the media that is responsible for invasion of privacy. This is not just about those whose careers put them in the public eye, but ordinary people who through no fault of their own have come to public notice because of some event that has attracted the attention of the media. It might be that a member of their family has been imprisoned for some crime, rightfully or wrongfully, or perhaps they are the victimsof some natural disaster. Some people argue that those who have chosen to be in the public sphere, and have teams of public relations people to make sure they get as much public attention as possible – actors, rock stars, politicians and the like – have given up their right to privacy and gel everything they deserve."
