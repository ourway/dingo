    "text": "From the earliest civilizations, plants and animals have been portrayed as a means of understanding and recording their potential uses, such as their economic and healing properties. From the first  illustrated catalogue  of medicinal plants, De Materia Medica by Dioscorides, in the first century, through to the late fourteenth century, the illustration of plants and animals changed very little. Woodcuts in instructional manuals and herbals were often repeatedly copied over the centuries, resulting in a loss of definition and accuracy so that they became little more than stylized decoration. With the growing  popularity  of copperplate engravings, the traditional use of woodcuts declined and the representation of plants and animals became more  accurate . Then, with the emergence of  artists  such as Albrecht DÃ¼rer and Leonardo Da Vinci, naturalists such as Otto Brunfels, Leonhard Fuchs in botany and Conrad Gesner and Ulisse Aldrovandi in zoology, nature began to be depicted  in a more realistic style. Individual living plants or animals were observed directly and their likeness rendered  onto paper or vellum."
