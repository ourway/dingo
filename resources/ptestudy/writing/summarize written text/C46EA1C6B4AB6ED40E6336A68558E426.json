    "text": "Fish are being killed, and prevented from reaching maturity, by the litter of plastic particles finding their way into the worldâ€™s oceans, new research has proved.  Some young fish have been found to prefer tiny particles of plastic to their natural food sources, effectively starving them before they can reproduce.  The growing problem of micro plastics-tiny particles of polymer-type materials from modern industry-has been thought for several years to be a peril for fish, but the study published on Thursday is the first to prove the damage in trials.  Micro plastics are near-indestructible in natural environments. They enter the oceans through litter, when waste such as plastic bags, packaging and other convenience materials are discarded. Vast amounts of these end up in the sea, through inadequate waste disposal systems and sewage outfall.  Another growing source is microbeads, tiny particles of hard plastics that are used in cosmetics, for instance as an abrasive in modern skin cleaners. These easily enter waterways as they are washed off as they are used, flushed down drains and forgotten, but can last for decades in our oceans.  The impact of these materials has been hard to measure, despite being a growing source of concern. Small particles of plastics have been found in seabirds, fish and whales, which swallow the materials but cannot digest them, leading to a build-up in their digestive tracts. For the first time, scientists have demonstrated that fish exposed to such materials during their development show stunted growth and increased mortality rates, as well as changed behavior that could endanger their survival."
