Rather predictably, they are Jack Welch and General Electric, and Bill Gates, and Microsoft.  neither  have achieved their world class status through playing nice. Wetch is still remembered for the brutal downsizing he led his business  through  and for the environmental pollution incidents and prosecutions. Microsoft has had one of the  highest  profile cases of bullying market dominance of recent times – and Gates has been able to  achieve  the financial status where he can choose to give lots of money away by being ruthless in business."
