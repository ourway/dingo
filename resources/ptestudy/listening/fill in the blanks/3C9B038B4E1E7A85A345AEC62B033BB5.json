    "text": "Demand for this exotic fabric eventually created thelucrative  trade route now known as the Silk Road, taking silk westward and bringing gold, silver and wool to the East. It was named the Silk Road after its most precious commodity which was considered to be worth more than gold. The Silk Road stretched over 6,000 kilometers from Eastern China to the Mediterranean Sea, following the Great Wall of China, climbing the Pamir mountain range crossing modern-day Afghanistan and going on to the Middle East, with a major trading market in Damascus."
