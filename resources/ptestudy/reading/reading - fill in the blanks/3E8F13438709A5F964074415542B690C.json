    "text": "With their punk hairstyles and bright colors, marmosets and tamarins are among the most attractive primates on earth. Theo fast-moving, lightweight animals live in the rainforests of South America. Their small size  makes  it easy for them to dart about the trees, catching insects and small animals such as lizards, frogs, and snails. Marmosets have another unusual food  source  â€”they use their chisel-like incisor teeth to dig into tree bark and lap up the gummy op that seeps out, leaving telltale, oval-shaped  holes in the branches when they have finished. But as vast tracts of rainforest are clearly for plantations of cattle ranches marmosets and tamarins are in serious  danger  of extinction."
