    "text": "Human migration, the term is vague. What people usually think of is the permanent movement of people from one home to another. More broadly, though, migration means all the ways – from the seasonal drift of agricultural workers within a country to the relocation of refugees from one country to another.Migration is big, dangerous, compelling. It is 60 million Europeans leaving home from the 16th to the 20th centuries. It is 15 million Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims swept up in a tumultuous shuffle of citizens between India and Pakistan after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947.Migration is the dynamic undertow of population change: everyone’s solution, everyone’s conflict. As the century turns, migration, with its inevitable economic and political turmoil, has been called “one of the greatest challenges of the coming century”.But it is much more than that. It is, as it has always been, the great adventure of human life. Migration helped create human, drove us to conquer the planet, shape our societies, and promises to reshape them again.“You have a history book written in you genes.” said Spencer Wells. The book he’s trying to read goes back to long before even the first word has written, and it is a story of migration."
