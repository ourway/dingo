    "text": "Conduct disorder in children is very serious. It’s a disorder of childhood and adolescence that is long term, that’s chronic, where children have very aggressive impulses, where children are involved in difficulties with the law and really seem to have no regard for the rules or for authority. When children have conduct disorder they are definitely at risk of carrying these difficulties into adulthood which also brings about a myriad of different problems. Children with conduct disorder often have difficulties in schools, have difficulty with relationships and have difficulty with employment and lifelong long-term relationships. It’s important to recognize that if your child is not doing well in school, if your child has had difficulty where legal action was necessary, if your child is bullying, getting into fights and this is constant and ongoing, if your child does not get help these complexities will really exacerbate into other major difficulties. Look for signs of your child’s grades dropping, look for signs of repeated detentions, suspensions and brushes with the law. Parents please recognize that if your child has signs of conduct disorder the sooner you get help, the sooner your child can start to learn more adaptive behaviors."
