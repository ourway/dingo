      "Knowledge of basic laws of inheritance was available much before Gregor Mendel, though he studied the phenomenon scientifically and pioneered genetics.",
      "The work of Gregor Mendel gave us keen insights into the mechanics of inheritance and we slowly unraveled the role of genes, which, apart from external environment, determined human traits.",
      "Gregor Mendel pioneered the study of inheritance though he did not know its mechanics. Today we know better about genetic and environmental influences on human traits.",
      "Gregor Mendel identified specific traits of inheritance and studied the discrete influence of genetics and environment on human appearance and behavior"

    "text": "Key words: modern science of genetics, only began, works of Mendel, observed specific traits, inherited, called genes, interaction with environment, determine, outcome. Option (1) It is too much to say that knowledge of basic laws was available before Mendel’s time. Option (3) puts Mendel’s work in rather poor light. Option (4) ascribes later discoveries also to Mendel. Hence, Option (2) is the answer."
