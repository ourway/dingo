    "text": "Sometimes a work of art is so dazzlingly famous that it can blind people to its original context and meaning. That surely is the case with Vincent Van Gogh’s Sunflowers.Take the version in London’s National Gallery that the Dutch artist painted in Arles in the South of France in August 1888. Fifteen sunflowers erupt out of a simple earthenware pot against a blazing yellow background. Some of the flowers are fresh and perky, ringed with halos of flickering, flame-like petals. Others are going to seed and have begun to droop. Last year, more postcards of this painting were sold in the gallery’s shop – the exact figure was 26,110 – than of any other picture in the entire collection.But many of the more than 5 million people who visit the National Gallery every year will be unaware that the painting belongs to a series of four extraordinary sunflower still lifes that Van Gogh created in less than a week during the summer of 1888, when a cold northerly wind prevented him from working outdoors.The first of these, now in a private collection and sometimes described as Van Gogh’s ‘unknown’ Sunflowers, shows three yellow-orange blooms in a green glazed pot against a turquoise background. It has not been exhibited since 1948, when it was lent to the Cleveland Museum of Art for a month. A second picture, again with three flowers in a pot as well as three more on the table in the foreground, in front of a rich royal blue wall, was destroyed during the American bombardment of the Japanese town of Ashiya in 1945. A third painting, similar to the one in the National Gallery, but with 14 sunflowers and a turquoise background, is in the Neue Pinakothek gallery in Munich. Moreover, not long after he had executed these four Sunflowers, Van Gogh created three further replicas or variations – one of which is being loaned by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam to the National Gallery, where the two pictures will hang side by side from 25 January until 27 April."
