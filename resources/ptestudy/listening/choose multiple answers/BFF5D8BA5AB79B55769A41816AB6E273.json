    "text": "Technological change has had a profound effect on the way music is made and how it sounds, as well as on the way we listen to it. New technologies -and I mean this in the broadest sense, not just electronic devices – can alter the sound of music and, in the case of electronic recording systems, affect the economics and distribution of music. For example, the innovation of the valve trumpet in the 19th century changed the sound of the orchestra. Now everyone has easy access to a wide variety of music, but it is arguable whether this has increased our understanding of it. Before radio and recorded music, those who could afford it would have pianos or pianolas – mechanical pianos that played a roll of sheet music – so the basic ability to read notes off a page was more widespread. However, these days, regardless of whether or not we are musical experts, there is no doubt that music enhances life, and with the Internet, sites to download music from, file-sharing, and so on, we have access to more music than ever before – and a lot of it for free."
