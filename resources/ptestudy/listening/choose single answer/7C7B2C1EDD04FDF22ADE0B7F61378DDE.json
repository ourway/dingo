    "text": "Actually, the word ‘malaria’ means ‘bad air’ in Italian and centuries ago that’s what people thought caused this very infectious disease. And who can blame them really? Who can blame them for making that, hmm, false connection? Who’d have thought that a tiny insect, like a mosquito, could cause so much sickness? Mmm. Yes. More surprising perhaps is the fact that it’s taken scientists so much time since then to come up with a cure. Ahah. Well that’s what we’re going to talk about now. Because it does seem that this is now becoming a real possibility."
