As any newlywed couple knows, there is a huge amount of financial pressure associated with marriage. Firstly, the wedding reception and honeymoon will cost you an arm and a leg. Then there’s the matter of home loans, rent and energy bills. If you’re looking to start a family, your child’s education is another thing you need to save up for. Teenagers should probably find a proper job before deciding to tie the knot."
