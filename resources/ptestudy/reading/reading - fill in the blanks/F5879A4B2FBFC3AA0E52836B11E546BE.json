    "text": "The Roman people had at first been inclined to regard the French Revolution with either indifference or derision . But as the months went by and the  emigres  who remained in the city were less and less hopeful of an early return home, the mood of the Romans became increasingly antagonistic towards the ‘assassins of Paris’. The nationalization of Church property in France, the confiscation of papal territories, the  dwindling  of contributions and the  paucity  of tourists and pilgrims all contributed to an exacerbation of this antagonism."
