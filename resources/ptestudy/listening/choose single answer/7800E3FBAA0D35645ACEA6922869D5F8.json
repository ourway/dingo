    "text": "Listen to a part of a talk in science class. As you recall from our previous discussion, the chemistry of life is organized into metabolic pathways. next year in your organic chemistry lab you will go into this into metabolism in more depth. Since this is an intro course, you need only a general understanding of the process for now. there’s a wonderful videotape, I’d like you to know about that will help you review for the test next week. It’s part of the transformation series that was on television about a year ago. The episode you should watch is called the industry of a cell. I strongly urge you to see it. I believe our library has more than one copy. It shows lots of examples the many ways that cells use energy for metabolism, for example, it shows how the bacteria in the headlight of certain fish how these bacteria take the energy stored in food and converted into light in a process called bioluminescence. You should all try to see this program before next week. I highly recommend it. In fact, you can expect to see examples from it on the test."
