    "text": "People say you have to have a lot of passion for what you are doing and it’s totally true and The reason is because it’s so hard that if you don’t any rational person would give up. It’s really hard and you have to do it over a sustained period of time, so if you don’t love it, if you don’t have fun doing it, you don’t really love it, you are going to give up. And that’s what happened to most people actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up “unsuccessful” in the eyes of the society and the eyes of others. Often times, it is the ones that are successful love what they did so they persevere when it got very tough. And ones that didn’t love it, quit, cause they are sane. Who want to put up with stuff if you do not love it? So it’s a lot of hard work and it’s a lot of worrying, constantly. And if you don’t love it, you are going to fail. So you’ve got to love it, you’ve got to have passion. The second thing is you’ve got to be talent scout. It doesn’t matter how talent you are; you need a team of great people. You’ve got to figure out how to size people up fairly quickly, make decisions without knowing people too well and hire them and see how they do and refine your tuition. And be able to help build an organization that can eventually build itself. Because you need great people around you."
