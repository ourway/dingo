    "text": "Bees are incredible navigators and they can communicate the exact location of food source with surprising accuracy, using something known as the waggle dance. The eyes of a honeybee are able to detect the polarization of UV light from the sun as it passes through the Earth’s atmosphere. Now, our eyes can’t see in UV light. So, for us to understand kind of how this works for a bee we have here a polarizing filter. And if I rotate this, we can see that at a certain angle the image changes. Bees also have an internal clock which is accurate enough to calculate the exact position of the sun as it travels across the sky over the course of the day. So, this is what the waggle dance looks like, but how do we interpret this dance? In a vertical hive, the angle of the waggle compared to the up direction is the angle at which the bees need to fly relative to the sun to find the food. Let’s take a look inside a hive. So if the bee dances straight up that tells the other bees to fly directly towards the sun. So if you take a look at this footage from inside a real hive you can see what this waggle dance really looks like. If the bee dances at 45 degrees to the right that means to fly at 45 degrees to the right of the sun. As the day goes by. The bee uses its internal clock to adjust the angle of the dance to match the location of the sun in the sky letting fellow bees always know the right direction to fly. To find the food the waggle also contains information about the distance to the food with a longer waggle meaning that the food is further away."
