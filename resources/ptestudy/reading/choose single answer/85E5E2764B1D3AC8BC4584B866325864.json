    "text": "Sodium Chloride, or salt, is essential for human life. Salt has been used by humans for thousands of years as a food seasoning and preservative. The mineral sodium is an electrolyte – an electrically-charged ion – that enables cells to carry electrical impulses to other cells, for example muscle contractions. Electrolytes also regulate the body’s fluid levels. A diet deficient in salt can cause muscle cramps, neurological problems and even death. Conversely, a diet high in salt leads to an increased risk of conditions such as hypertension, heart disease and stroke."
