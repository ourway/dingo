Previous research has linked cuteness to early ethological ideas of a “kindchenschema” (infant schema) where infant facial features serve as “innate releasing mechanisms” for importantintangibleinstinctualintendedinstinctualcaregiving behaviors. We propose extending the concept of cuteness beyond visual features to include positive infant sounds and smells. Evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies links this extended concept of cuteness to simple “instinctual” behaviors and to caregiving protection and complex emotions.
