    "text": "Group work is increasingly an important part of university study and students are likely to be asked to produce assignments with other group members. Some of the benefits of group work are that it prepares students for teamwork. something that they will probably encounter in the workplace. Also, work can be shared and it tends to produce more creative solutions to problems.However. we should be aware that conflicts may occur as individuals negotiate their place in the group and different personalities try to work together. To help overcome potential conflicts, the group can define the major task they need to complete, and then break the larger group objective into smaller tasks. Itâ€™s important to develop strategies to help the group achieve their short and longer term goals and to do this. individual roles (including leader) need to be assigned."
