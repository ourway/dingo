Because I’m presenting a paper at a conference in Detroit on Thursday, I won’t be here for either Wednesday’s or Friday’s class. I will, however, be here for Monday’s. Next Friday, a week from today, is the midterm exam, marking the halfway point in the semester. Professor Andrews has agreed to administer the exam. In place of the usual Wednesday class, I’ve arranged an optional review session. Since it is optional, attendance will not be taken; however, attending the class would be a good idea for those worried about the midterm. So, remember: optional class next Wednesday; midterm, Friday."
