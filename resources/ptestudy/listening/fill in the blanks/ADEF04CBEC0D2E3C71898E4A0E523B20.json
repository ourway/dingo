    "text": "Now, as you know already, there will be a midterm exam next week. The exam will be an open-book, open-note, and open-internet resource exam. But you can’t use a classmate or me during the exam. Many of the questions on this exam don’t have  definitive answers. I wish toassess your critical thinking ability and your ability to combine ideas. A poorly organized answer will not get the same grades as a well-organizedanswer. Here are some good ways to study for the exam. First of all, it would be better for you to organize and review your lecture notes. That means you many need to compile notes and lab test results  if you have not done that already. I strongly suggest that you write trial outlines before the exam. I think it will make you feel more comfortable. Just stop by my office."
