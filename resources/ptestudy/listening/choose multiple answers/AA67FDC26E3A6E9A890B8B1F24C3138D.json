    "question": "Which of these countries still use woodblock printing on fabrics?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Woodblocks used for pictorial illustration became fairly common in 15th century Europe, but had been used long before that for printing designs on textiles. Most of these were simple in design and quite crudely cut, but some were skillfully drawn and cut, while others even contained pictorial imagery. Records show that woodblock printing on fabrics was practised by the Egyptians as early as 2000 years BC. The oldest existing printed fabric, which is Egyptian, dates from the 4th century. At the same time, the craft seems to have been widely established, even commonplace, elsewhere: for example, in India, Mexico and Peru, where the same techniques continue to be practised today. And the technique was almost certainly used by both the Japanese and the Chinese too."
