    "text": "This busy little town is named after sir David’s first cousin. It’s also a Welsh language stronghold. According to the 2001 census results seventy percent of the town’s population could speak Welsh but even here the language may not be completely safe. The Welsh language board expects last year’s census results to show a fall in the number of Welsh speakers living in its northern and western heartlands. One of the main reasons for that the board says is migration. Many Welsh speakers are choosing to leave the country. At the same time only a small percentage of those moving in can speak the language or choose to learn it. Historically, over the past 1788 Wales people have continually left in order to find better standard of pay maybe in quality of employment and the things have change was probably is that them there is a larger amount of English people now who have found Wales of the last 20-25 years particularly this corner of Wales and regarded is a desirable place to come and live and as opposed to many areas in England and cheaper awell."
