    "text": "Students are increasingly finding it necessary to obtain employment in order to subsidize their income during their time in higher education. The  extra income helps to pay for necessities, to maintain a social life and to buy clothes, and holding a part-time job helps students to gain  skills for life after university or college. Using a part-time job to cut down on borrowing is a sound investment, as it reduces the  debt  that will be waiting to be paid off after graduation. How many hours students are currently working each week during term-time is not really certain. Some institutions advise that students should not work more than ten hours a week, and there are others that set a higher recommend limit  of fifteen hours a week. There is no doubt that some students  exceed  even fifteen hours a week."
