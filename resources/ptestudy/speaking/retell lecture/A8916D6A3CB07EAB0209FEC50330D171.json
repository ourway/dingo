We use different kinds of methods to describe a situation.Sometimes we have to use visual description, particularly when we donâ€™t have witness the scenario. I was born during the Second World War, and my hometown is London, for example when I asked my mother about the war, I always ask her you have mentioned this or that when you talked to me. When asked her about the shelter, I asked her what the shelter looks like and when did you go to the shelter.From her response, I could get more visual evidence as I can to write my book."
