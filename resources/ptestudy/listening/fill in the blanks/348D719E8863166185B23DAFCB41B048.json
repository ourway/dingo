    "text": "Crime in the United Statesaccounts for more death, injuries and loss of property then all Natural Disasters combined. The Disaster Center is pleased to be able to provide you with access to the statistics of crimecompiled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. When you experience a crime it can make you respond in ways that you might not understand. In that crisis situation you may react in ways that conflict with the assumptions  you have created about your self. At the time of the crime you may feel a sense of helplessness, fear and anger. Afterward you may have a hard time relating the experience to the  context of the assumptions of your life. A conflict often develops between your idea of the world before the crime and your idea of the world after the disaster. On top of this the victims and their relatives often experience financial problems, and time is often lost from work to handle the legal, insurance and personal problems associated with being a victim. The trauma associated with any crime often makes it hard for victims to cope with normal daily routines. And the victims of crime are frequently blamed by their friends for not being more careful. The trauma continues as victims of crime often find themselves ignored by law  enforcement  , and confused by the court system."
