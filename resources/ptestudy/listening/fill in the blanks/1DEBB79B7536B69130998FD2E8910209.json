    "text": "Three basic ingredients are required for a thunderstorm to form: moisture, rising unstable air, and a lifting mechanism . The sun heats the surface of the earth, which warms the air above it. If this warm surface air is forced  to rise, it will continue to rise as long as it weighs less and stays warmer than the air around it. As the air rises, it transfers from the surface of the earth to the upper levels of the atmosphere. The water vapor it contains begins to cool, releasing the heat, and it  condenses into a cloud. The cloud eventually grows upward into areas where the temperature is below freezing . Some of the water vapor turns to ice and some of it turns into water droplets. Both have electrical charges. Ice particles usually have positive charges, and rain droplets usually have negative charges. When the charges build up enough, they are discharged in a bolt of lightning , which causes the sound waves we hear as thunder. On the 7th February, 2008, thunderstorms ripped through the eastern parts of Australia. Winds gusting over 90 km/hr brought down trees on houses, power lines and roads. The city of Perth, Western Australia had its wettest February since 1992 when more than 40 mm of heavy rain fell and caused a 50 day drought  to end."
