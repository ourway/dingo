    "text": "From reading philosophy, I came up with three principles as the guiding principles for adjust city, of the principles of equity, democracy and diversity. Of these were derived from the works of a number of philosophers, most preeminently I supposed on Ross. My choice of word equity rather than equality is in fact based on Ross’s argument that a policy ought to distribute benefits to people where the worst off become better off. So the worst off don’t have to become equal to everybody else but no policy should in fact make those who are most disadvantaged more disadvantaged. And it means that we have to talk about the policy at the time it’s being enacted. To say, while we have to make our city more competitive because sometime and by and by, the benefits will trickle down to those people who were worst off doesn’t justify making them worst off as that time. We have a lot of examples on the world of people whose homes were destroyed in the name of the greater good and say eventually they will benefit. But equity means that you do not in fact take advantage of those people who are weakest."
