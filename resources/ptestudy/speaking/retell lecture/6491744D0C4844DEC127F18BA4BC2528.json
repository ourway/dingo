About a decade ago, statistician Persi Diaconis started to wonder if the outcome of a coin flip really is just a matter of chance. He had Harvard University engineers build him a mechanical coin flipper. Diaconis, now at Stanford University, found that if a coin is launched exactly the same way, it lands exactly the same way. The randomness in a coin toss, it appears, is introduced by sloppy humans. Eachhuman-generated flip has a different height and speed, and is caught at a differentangle, giving different outcomes. But using high speed cameras and equations, Diaconis and colleagues have nowfound that even though humans are largely unpredictable coin flippers, there’s stilla bias built in, if a coin starts out heads, it ends up heads when caught more oftenthan it does tails.
