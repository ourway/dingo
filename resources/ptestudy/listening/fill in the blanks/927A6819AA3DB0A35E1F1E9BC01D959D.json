    "text": "So, a lot of the research on happiness starts with the basic question: How happy are you? And we’re psychologists  , so tell us on a scale of 1 to 10, where 5 is average, 10 is super-duper. The most common answers, interestingly enough, are high; they’re 7 or 8. It turns out that most people think that they’re pretty happy. This question has been asked all over the world and it turns out that there are slight differences depending on how old you are; there are slight differences depending on your place  within a country, California versus New York; there are slight, subtle differences between men and women at different points . Somewhat paradoxically, although women are more vulnerable  to depression than men, still, on average, women are slightly happier than men."
