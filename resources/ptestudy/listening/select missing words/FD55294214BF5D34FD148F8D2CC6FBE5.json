    "text": "I don’t understand road rage. It is a problem that is getting worse all over the world. People are turning into monsters when they get behind the wheel of a car. They think the road belongs to them. They think they don’t have to follow speed limits or consider other drivers. I wonder why this is. What is it about cars and driving that turns normal people into maniacs? Some people simply hoot and shake their fists. The funny thing is that they also do the same things to make other drivers angry. Serious road rage happens when someone gets out of their car and gets angry. They can punch the other diver and sometimes even kill them. Why would you want to kill someone because they overtook you? Crazy."
