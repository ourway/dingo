    "text": "For anthropologists and archaeologists, rock art is a kind of window into our ancestors’ evolution，migration and lifestyle. These insights that we get from rock art are highly valued by archaeologists because they complement the often scant information provided by excavated objects.It turns out that there are common themes in rock art between sites in Europe and caves where they have discovered rock art in China. In fact，some recurring motifs in rock art have been observed all over the world. It is truly remarkable that the hunter-gatherers of the Yunnan province in China left very similar creations to the Magdalenians， who lived nearly 9,000 km away in Western Europe and thousands of years prior. Both feature outline images of human predators and prey, from bears and lions to stags，horses and bulls.Now, both regions were inhabited by hunter-gatherers，on similar terrain. But there’s more to it than that. One thing that we think it might reflect, this similarity of rock art in these distant places, is that human beings are essentially the same in their thinking. So，whether it’s the ancient people of Europe, or in Asia, they did things and drew things in very similar ways."
