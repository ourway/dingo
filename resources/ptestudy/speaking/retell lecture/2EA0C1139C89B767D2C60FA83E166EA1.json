Although interrelated, the three had its own function. Primitive brain functions to manage the physical to survive, manage reflex, motor motion control, monitoring body functions, and process information coming from sensing. Limbic brain functioning as a liaison to process emotions and the brain thinks, and the primitive brain. While the thinking brain, which is the most objective part of the brain, receiving input from the primitive brain and the limbic brain. However, he needed more time to process information from the primitive brain and the limbic brain. The brain thinks the merger is also a place of experience, memory, feeling, and thinking ability to give birth to ideas and actions. Nerve myelination of the brain take place in sequence, starting from the primitive brain, the limbic brains, and brain thought. Neural pathways are more frequently used to make more myelin thicken. Increasingly thicker myelin,the faster the nerve impulses or signals travel alone nerves. Therefore, a growing child is encouraged to receive input from the environment in accordance with its development. This lecture talks about brain development during childhood. There are three stages, starting from the action brain, felling brain and thought brain. These three stages have its own functions, including managing the physical to survive, monitoring body functions and processing information coming from sensing. Nerve myelination of the brain take place in sequence, and increasingly thicker myelin, the faster the nerve impulses or signals travel alone nerves. Therefore, a growing child is encouraged to receive input from the environment in accordance with its development."
