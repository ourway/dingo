    "text": "When we have droughts, the rings were very narrow and the more extreme the narrower the ring is we’re trying to identify patterns and widen their wings. You can come to think of that as a barcode in the food that you might buy in the store, trees in an area you have not exactly the same pattern, but a similar pattern of wide and narrow range just like that barcode. We get to the point where we can just look across samples okay there’s 1580 and their 1735. We know where those difficult years are we able to look at the records in the rings. And from that reconstruct streamflow much further back than we can just with historical records in some areas under the best conditions were the best species we can have up to 10,000 years record from tree rings. we have maybe 5200 years historical records from the rivers around here. We have trees and go back several hundred years. If you look at the Weaver River, We have about 100 years of record. to gives us a rough idea of how long droughts of Benin have severely been but it’s only hundred years record and the trees a been around for six or 700 or more years, how can they give us a much longer record of those droughts. sometimes as we look in the tree rings we see droughts that are much longer, much more severe than anything we see in the historical record. We’ve had droughts that have lasted for more than a decade we had one of the last for 16 years, water managers can actually incorporate those in the forecast models to help us better prepare for droughts in future. We are excited to be able to take the information and give that water managers now because they haven’t had that for the Wasatch front before."
