    "text": "Carbon-rich soil is darkcrumbly and fertile, and retains some water. But erosion can occur if soil is dry, which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate . amounts of carbon. Erosion is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed  animals on that terrain  In the 1970s and 80s, Lal was studying soils in Africa so devoid  of organic matter that the ground had become extremely hard, like cement. There he met a pioneer  in the study of global warming, who suggested that carbon from the soil had moved into the atmosphere. This is now looking increasingly  likely."
