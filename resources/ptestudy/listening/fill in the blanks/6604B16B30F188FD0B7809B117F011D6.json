    "text": "I’d recommend that you all try to get hold of English in the Southern Hemisphere by Nalan and Watts, as this provides an excellent overview of the topics that we’re going to be covering in this module. It’s really our primarytext. It has particularly strong sections on the history of English in Australia and New Zealand, examining in some depth how the language has developedin these countries. The sections on phonology and on vocabulary will be invaluable when you’re doing the written assignment, which I’m going to be telling you about in a moment once I’ve given you the details of a couple of other essential references."
