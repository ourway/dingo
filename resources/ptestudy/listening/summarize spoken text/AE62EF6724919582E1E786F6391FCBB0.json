    "text": "I have been writing nonfiction for years actually and but secretly wanting to be novelist. When I first started writing at the age of 30, it was with the intention of writing fiction but it took a little detour for 10 or 12 years and wrote nonfiction which I have absolutely no regret about it at all. I think was exactly the right thing for me to do. But there was that dream tucked away inside of me to do this. Now remember reading something that Eudora Welty wrote who is you know the great novelist from Mississippi who had a big influence on me actually. She said no art ever came out of not risking your neck and I think sheâ€™s absolutely right about that. It felt that way to me at the time. It actually feels that way to me every time I sit down to write something. Finally, in the early 90s, I took my deep breath and started writing fiction. It felt risky to me at the time to do that and one of the very first things that I wrote was what I thought was going to be the first chapter of the novel called the secret life of Bees. I wrote it in 1992 and it is actually essentially the first chapter of the novel as it is now."
