    "text": "Steven Pinker, a cognitive psychologist best known for his book “The Language Instinct”, has called music “auditory cheesecake, an exquisite confection crafted to tickle the sensitive spots of at least six of our mental faculties. If it vanished from our species, he said, “The rest of our lifestyle would be virtually unchanged.” Others have argued that, on the contrary music along with art and literature, is part of what makes people human; its absence would have a brutalizing effect. Philip Ball, a British science writer and an avid music enthusiast, comes down somewhere in the middle. He says that music is ingrained in our auditory, cognitive and motor functions. We have a music  instinct as much as a language instinct, and could not rid ourselves of it if we tried."
