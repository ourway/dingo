    "text": "If there is an objective truth about what is morally right and wrong, why is there so much disagreement about such matters? Many believe that objective truths of any kind must be such as to garner consensus about them, at least among people who are well situated to appreciate such things. But it doesnâ€™t take an expert to realise that such consensus is extremely elusive in ethics. So persistent moral disagreement presents us with a choice. Perhaps there are no moral facts at all. Or there are, but ones that are not objective. Either way, the moral realist loses."
