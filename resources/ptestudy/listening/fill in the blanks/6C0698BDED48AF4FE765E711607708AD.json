    "text": "He about the same time was so much displeased with the performances  of a nobleman’s French cook, that he exclaimed with vehemence, “I’d throw such a rascal into the river”,and he then proceeded to alarm a lady at whose house he was to sup, by the following manifesto  of his skill: “I, Madam, who live at a variety of good tables, am a much better judge of cookery, than any person who has a very tolerable cook, but lives much at home; for his palate is gradually adapted to the taste of his cook; whereas  , Madam, in trying by a wider range, I can moreexquisitely judge.” When invited to dine, even with an intimate friend, he was not pleased if something better than a plain dinner was not prepared for him. I have heard him say on such an occasion, “This was a good dinner enough, to be sure; but it was not a dinner to ASK a man to.” On the other hand, he was wont to express, with great  glee , his satisfaction when he had been entertained quite to his mind."
