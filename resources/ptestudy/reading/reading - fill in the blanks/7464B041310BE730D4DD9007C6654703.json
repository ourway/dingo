    "text": "When that happens, staff will help the person –  strung out and now a little stressed –fish their drugs out of the rubbish. On their way out, they might have a blood test, their first  dental check-up in years, or just a hot cup of Milo. The majority are dependent on their  substances  . The purpose is not to be a place that  facilitates injection per se, the purpose is to keep people alive.” The center is a response to a coroner’s report that noted the 34 heroin-related deaths in the area in 2016."
