Psychologists have a technique for looking at intelligence that canmustdoesshalldoes not require the cooperation of the animal involved. The relative size of an individual’s brain is a reasonable indication of intelligence. Comparing overacrosswithin acrossspecies is not as simple an elephant will have a larger brain than a human simple because it is a large beast. InsteadMoreoverHoweverActuallyInstead we use the Cephalization index, which compare the size of an animal’s brain to the size of its body.

As a general theorywayrulemodelruleanimals that hunt for a living (like canines) are smarter than strict vegetarians (you don’t need much intelligence to outsmart a leaf of lettuce). Animals that live in social groups are always smarter and have large EQ’s than solitary animals."
