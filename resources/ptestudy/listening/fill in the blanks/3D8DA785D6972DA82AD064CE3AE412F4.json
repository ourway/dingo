    "text": "Sweet potatoes contain fiber, vitamin A and calciumBut the way that scientists think they can make them even more healthful is literally shocking. Researchers found that giving a jolt of electricity  to sweet potatoes increased the level of antioxidants known as polyphenols by 60 percent. The  investigators placed sweet potatoes in a solution of sodium chloride. They found that 0.2 amps of direct current gave the potatoes nearly one and a half times more antioxidants than potatoes that weren’t shocked. The research was presented at the National Meeting of the American Chemical Society. It seems that the electric zap stressed  the potatoes into producing more polyphenols as a protective mechanism  And the treatment did not sacrifice flavor. Previous research has shown that electrically supercharging white potatoes increases antioxidant levels. So perhaps it’s only a matter of time before other fruits and vegetables get shock therapy too.Re-Start"
