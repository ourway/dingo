This does not mean that essays are a “regurgitation” of everything your lecture has said throughout the course. Essays are your opportunity to explore in greater depths aspects of the course theories, issues, texts etc., and in some cases relate these aspects to a particular context. It is your opportunity to articulate your ideas, but in a certain  way: using formal academic style."
