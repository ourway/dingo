    "text": "This is the first ocean deployment of two new high-precision instruments designed to monitor the Earthâ€™s signals from the seafloor. This housing contains the tilt meter and nano bottom pressure recorder and the associated electronics and cabling used for power and communications. The instruments were deployed on the sea floor by a remotely operated vehicle as part of the Mars seafloor. Observatory test bed located at a depth of three thousand feet in Monterey Bay in this first test deployment in the ocean. It has already detected the ground motion from several large earthquakes as far from the Mars site as Chile and the Mariana Trench in the future. The instruments will be part of a global network of cabled seafloor observatories. Because of their precision these two new instruments are already detecting signals, which could never be measured before."
