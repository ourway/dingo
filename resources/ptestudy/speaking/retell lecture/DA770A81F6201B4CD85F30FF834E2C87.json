    "text": "When you look at the label on a hazardous chemical product, the lovely picture looks nice and won’t make people think of dangerous meanings. The warning information is only displayed at the back. This design is very concerning. The warning font is small, which makes it even more difficult to read. 60% of Americans cannot recognize fonts smaller than size 10, and 40% of Americans are illiterate. While people cannot recognize easily or cannot read, they won’t be aware of the hazards of these chemical products."
