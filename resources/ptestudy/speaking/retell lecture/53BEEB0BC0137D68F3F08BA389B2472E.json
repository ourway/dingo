    "text": "Today, we will discuss the relationship between the fault lines in the Earth’s crust and an earthquake. This dislocation of the rock occurs from the Earth’s surface, seven kilometers to serval hundred kilometers vertically down to the crust . The earthquake’s focus is called epicenter which is vertically beneath the interior of the Earth’s crust and the energy releases and transfers through epicenter. The faults are the fracture on the Earth’s crust. The position of the epicenters can be identified by the faults’maps, looking down from the center of the Earth. It will result in seismic wave which is decreased as it moved away from the epicenter."
