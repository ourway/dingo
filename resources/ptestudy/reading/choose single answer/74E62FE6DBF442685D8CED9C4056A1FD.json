    "text": "Clothing expresses who you are in symbolic form that is also functional. To say it is “symbolic” is to say that it presents to the world a visual image of a quality of your inner being, and one possible quality might be your desire to be part of a social group or to identify with a cultural ideal you admire and desire to adopt for yourself. To say it is “functional” means that it has a practical purpose or use in relation to the world in which you live."
