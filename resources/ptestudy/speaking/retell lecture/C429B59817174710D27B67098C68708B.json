    "text": "We then searched through 80 jurisdictions, it took us seven years ,to find the jurisdiction where we wanted to begin filing our first suit. We chose the state of New York. Then we decided upon who our plaintiffs are going to be. We decided upon chimpanzees, not just because Jane Goodall was on our board of directors, but because they, Jane and others, have studied chimpanzees intensively for decades. We know the extraordinary cognitive capabilities that they have, and they also resemble the kind that human beings have. And so we chose chimpanzees ,and we began to then canvass the world to find the experts in chimpanzee cognition . We found them in Japan, Sweden, Germany, Scotland, England and the United States, and amongst them, they wrote 100 pages of affidavits in which they set out more than 40 ways in which their complex cognitive capability, either individually or together, all added up to autonomy and self-determination. Now, these included, for example, that they were conscious. But they’re also conscious that they’re conscious . They know they have a mind. They know that others have minds. They know they’re individuals, and that they can live. They understand that they lived yesterday and they will live tomorrow. They engage in mental time travel. They remember what happened yesterday. They can anticipate tomorrow, which is why it’s so terrible to imprison a chimpanzee, especially alone. It’s the thing that we do to our worst criminals, and we do that to chimpanzees without even thinking about it."
