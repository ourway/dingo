    "text": "There are four fundamental forces at work in the universe. Some of them are very familiar from everyday life, some of them are not, so we all know about gravity, that’s one of the four forces, it’s what keeps us ankles to the surface of the earth, keeps the Earth in orbit around the Sun. There is another force that we’re very familiar with, which is the electromagnetic force, that is the force that is responsible for the electricity, electric currents for light, for the sun’s light, that’s electromagnetic radiation coming from the Sun to the Earth. There are two other forces though, that are somewhat less familiar, they are the nuclear forces. They are forces that are at work within the nuclear atoms. One of those forces is called the strong nuclear force, that really is the force that bides protons to proton, bides the corks inside of the protons and neutrons keeping them from flying out. The other nuclear force is called the weak nuclear force. And that’s a force that predominantly we know of because it’s responsible for radio activity, radioactive decay. So those four forces, strong nuclear force, weak nuclear force, electromagnetic force and gravitational force, those are the forces that work in the universe."
