    "text": "Today globalization encompasses the whole world and deals with it as an integral unit. The macro-world in which we live is exposed to distortions because of the unpredictable side-effects of a micro-world we do not and cannot totally control.This raises the need for a global system of checks and balances, for mandatory rules and constrains in our dealings with nature, in short, for a new type of veto designed to manage what is increasingly becoming a main contradiction of our time: the one between technology and ecology.A new type of international machinery must be set in place to cope with the new challenges. We need a new look at the harnessing of scientific discoveries, to maximize their positive effects for the promotion of humanity as a whole and to minimize their negative effects. We need an authority with veto powers to forbid practices conducive to decreasing the ozone hole, the propagation of AIDS, global warming, desertification â€“ an authority that will tackle such global problems.There should be no discontinuity in the global machinery responsible for would order. The UN in its represent form may fall far short of what it required of it, and it may be undemocratic and detrimental to most citizens in the world, but its absence would be worse. And so we have to hold on to the international organization even as we push forward for its complete restructuring."
