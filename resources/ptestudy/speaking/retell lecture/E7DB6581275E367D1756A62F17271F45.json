    "text": "Super-symmetry is a mathematical idea that people have developed an effort to understand the sharpest organizing principle for the fundamental constituents of matter. You see, we have learned that particles that seem to be different, can actually secretly be united by certain symmetry principles. So we use the fact that there are symmetric objects in the world like a sphere or basketball. You turn a sphere, and even though you’ve transformed it, it looks the same fundamentally. We found that certain particles when you transform one particle into another, even though looks like the identity of the particle has changed, overall the equations describing it they don’t change at all at an underlying level of symmetry, but we’ve not been able to do is find a symmetry that would relate certain kinds of particles, namely matter particles and force particles. Matter particles are particles like electron, muons and corks, force particles are like photons and gluons and WZ bosons. Super-symmetry is a symmetry that actually relates to these two kinds, these two classes of particles. And people have proven that super-symmetry is the last possible symmetry of the fundamental particles that are mathematics, reality has not yet been shown to make use of it. So people are now trying to see whether that symmetry might actually be working in the world can be found evidence for it in our understanding of fundamental particles."
