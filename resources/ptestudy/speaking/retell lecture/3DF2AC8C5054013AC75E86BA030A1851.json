    "text": "According to the World Health Organization, 400 million people worldwide have no access to essential health care. That is a staggering number of people. Some of those services include things like basic sanitation and clean water prenatal care and vaccinations or immunizations for children. Many things contribute to this crisis sometimes people live to remotely to get timely care if the emergency occurs even when living in a city the patient to doctor ratio can be as high as 50,000 people to just one doctor. Making it impossible for that doctor to meet the demands of health care in that area. These are valuable people made in the image of God who are physically suffering many of them without a personal relationship with Christ. So we do this with a week of hands-on training consisting of a variety of topics like basic sanitation and hygiene taking vital signs wound care and infection prevention basic birth assisting and emergency skills. Those who participate in the training then have practical skills in supplies to care for others in their community in a way that glorifies God and opens the door for sharing the gospel in a new way brought to you."
