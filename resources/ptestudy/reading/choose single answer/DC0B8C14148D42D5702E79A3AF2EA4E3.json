    "text": "Submarine operators have been alerted to the dangers of sea snails in a recent study. An international research team says the hardy deep-sea animals latch on to the submarines used by scientists， potentially spreading disease in pristine ecosystems.  The limpet is a sea snail that lives 2000 metres underwater but can also survive in air when a submarine emerges from the water. If it goes unnoticed，the limpet can find itself in another habitat the next time the submarine is used. As 90 per cent of limpets are infected by parasites，this poses a threat to the ecosystem; but thoroughly cleaning the submarines will solve the problem."
