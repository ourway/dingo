    "text": "Jainism is a religion of Indian origin which emphasizes the practice of non-violence to all living things. It is believe that Jainism was founded between the 9th and 6th century BC with roots from the Indus Valley civilisation, which spanned across the Indian subcontinent. Jainism is a minority religion in India, with estimated 4.2 million followers, and only small Jain enclave communities within the United States, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. Jains will attempt to limit their negative impact on other living beings. Jainism holds a similar set of beliefs to Hindu and Buddhist traditions, such as similar concepts of karma, cosmology and the soul. Similarly, the Jain’s metaphysical beliefs regarding the soul, spiritual energy and positive/negative karma highlight similarities to other major eastern religions. Although a relatively small religion, Jainism has had a significant impact on other local, eastern religions, and the Jains continue to practice their faith around the world."
