    "text": "Piccadilly Circus was full of loneliness. It seethes and echoes with it. To live near it. Looking down on it is a discomforting exercise. You canâ€™t feel the pulse of London here, though people expect to. To Londoners it is a maddening obstruction between one place and another, and few voluntarily linger there. The only locals are those who live off the lingerers; the lingerers are primarily sightseers, with a fair sprinkling of people hoping to draw attention to themselves both typically from the provinces. They have come to see the heart of London and expect to see spectacle, glamour and vice."
