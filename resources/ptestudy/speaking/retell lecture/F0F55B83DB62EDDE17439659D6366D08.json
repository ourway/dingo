I think over time throughout history, cities have changed in whether they were strategic spaces or routinized spaces. This, our global modernity is the time when cities are strategic. That does not mean all cities but that means that certain city throughout the world becomes spaces where our most acute problems, our major government challenges, hit the ground, become concrete , become urgent. The city, urban space has a capacity to pull down a lot of stuff that otherwise stated up there. Take the environmental question national states can talk and talk and talk for years. Kyoto took years but in the meantime, cities had to deal with the environment list."
