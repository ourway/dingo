It wasn’t planned all at once. It just grew up over time, beginning in the eighth century B.C..Now this is interesting. Because what we know about the Romans is when they were left to their own devices and they could build the city from scratch, they didn’t let it grow in an ad hoc way. They, they structured it in a, in a very care-, very methodical way. That was basically based on military strategy, military planning. The Romans they couldn’t have conquered the world without obviously having a masterful military enterprise . And they everywhere they went on their various campaigns, their various military campaigns .They would build, build camps and those camps were always laid out in a very geometric plan along a grid, usually square or rectangular."
