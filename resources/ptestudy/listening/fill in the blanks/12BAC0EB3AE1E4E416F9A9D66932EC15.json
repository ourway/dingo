    "text": "In Italy, some of these cities were able to gain control of thesurrounding country and to become city states, resembling those of the ancient Greeks. Theirautonomy was assisted by the continuing struggle between Popes and Emperors, between church and state, again, a thoroughly unique Western experience.
