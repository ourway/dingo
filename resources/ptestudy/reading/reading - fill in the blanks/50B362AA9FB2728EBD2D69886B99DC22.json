    "text": "Now that doesn’t mean that plainness is the only good style, or that you should becomea slave to spare, unadorned writing. Formality and ornateness have their place, and in competent hands complexity can carry us on a dizzying breathtaking journey. But most students, most of the time, should strive to be sensibly simple, to develop a baseline style of short words, active verbs, and relatively simple sentences conveying clear actions or identities. It’s faster, it makes arguments easier to follow, it increases the  chances a busy reader will bother to pay attention, and it lets you focus more attention on your moments of  rhetorical  flourish, which I do not advise abandoning altogether."
