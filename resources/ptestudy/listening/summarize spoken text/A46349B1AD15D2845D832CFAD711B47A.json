    "text": "In the United States, the government is discussing about epidemic transmitting. This is a worrying issue. The United States government is planning to use antiviral drugs to prevent the epidemic transmitting. This is only possible because the government of the United States have access to abundant resources. However, this is not the truth of the developing countries. It is more difficult for them to prevent epidemic transmitting because the government of developing countries have to face the challenge of lower number resources."
