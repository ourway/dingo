    "text": "Quantum foam is an idea that emerges from the application of quantum physics to the fabric of space and time itself. You see Einstein taught us in general activity that space and time are not in an inert backdrop. They participate in an unfolding of the cosmos space and time can warp and curve that creates the force of gravity. When you recognize that space and time are dynamic, they can change that they’re real physical entities. Well, they must be subject to the laws of quantum physics. And the key element of quantum physics it’s relevant is the uncertainty principle. When applying to the space and time, it’s a space and time are uncertain which means they can wildly fluctuate. They can in a sense look like the violently boiling surface of a pot of water. When you examine space and time and fantastically small scales. So the idea is that if you examine space in small and small scales, not everyday scales, but tiny scales the uncertainty gets bigger and bigger and space and time became foam-like. They look bubbly. They look phonetic undulating. That’s quantum foam down of the ultra microscopic scale that we’ve been struggling to deal with for decades because the math Einstein doesn’t work down there. The math quantum mechanics and the math Einstein lock horns, we’ve been trying to resolve that conflict in the essence to understand what truly is going on with the quantum foam."
