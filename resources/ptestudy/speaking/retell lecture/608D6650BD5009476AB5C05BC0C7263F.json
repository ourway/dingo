    "text": "Turner, not surprisingly painted one of the earliest pictures of London’s fog in this 1835 painting The Thames above Waterloo Bridge. Turner as a true born Londoner is advertising his familiarity with London’s air problem by putting smoke and atmospheric pollution at its center. And as you can see in here the bridges the central elements which is a theme that’s later taken up by Monet and it’s partly obscured by the steam and smoke which rises from both sides of the river. Here we see a shot tower I think you can just about see which was constructed in 1826. Do you know what shot turners are? They produce shot for guns ammunition and they were very smoky one of the more smoking industries. But it’s barely visible as you can see as are the various industries on the London side of the river. There’s on this side there’s a steamship about to dock or preparing to leave it’s black smoke thrusting up to join the kind of swirling arc of smoke there."
