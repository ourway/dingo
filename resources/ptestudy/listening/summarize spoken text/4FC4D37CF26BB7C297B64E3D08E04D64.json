    "text": "Talent is premium and there is a war for talents in 1990s because of the talent shortage. Companies and countries are recruiting young talented people from different countries and sending young people to universities. Some young people immigrated after graduated from the university. They compete with local students. Countries and organizations should put talents at the primary positions. The collapse of loyalty makes employees happy to change their workplace for higher income. There are three reasons, first the change of nature of economy leads to increase in the talentâ€™s demand and skills needed. Second, the shrinking labor force of the baby boom causes less supply of skilled workers and the retirement of baby boomers will cause a shortage of experienced workers. Third, there is also a mismatch between what schools are producing and what companies need."
