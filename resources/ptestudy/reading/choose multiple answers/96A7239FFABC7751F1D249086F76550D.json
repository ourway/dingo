  },
  {
    "text": "In her self – portraits, Frida Kahlo blends realism and fantasy to capture the psychological and physical pain she constantly endured as a result of the trolley car accident she experienced as a young women. This self – representation sets her apart from her contemporaries, who were more interested in public forms of art, such as murals. This was the time of the Mexican revolution, after all, a period that fostered an interest in nationalistic themes.  The more well – known artists of period included David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco and Juan O Gorman. These figures dominated the Mexican art world in the 1920s and 1930s. Unlike her contemporaries, Frida Kahlo’s work did not achieve recognition until long after her death. In the late twentieth century, she became a feminist icon, a phenomenon attributable to the candor with which she portrayed issues relating to women."
