    "text": "Here are Steven Sanderson Kent Redford of WCS Wildlife Conservation Society, probably pointing a finger at the poverty alleviation movement, and saying in its new incarnation it’s largely subsumed or supplanted conservation. The trend has gone unnoticed but it poses a significant threat to conservation objectives, and what they’re basically saying is if you’re interested in protecting the biosphere you ought to get on with that job. you shouldn’t be distracted by the equally significant but different agendas of reducing poverty. At the same time you’ve got to British social scientists, here Dilysrow works for the International Institute for Environment and development in London and Joe Elliott actually works for wildlife works for African Wildlife Foundation and nowadays But she’s saying here poor people should not pay the price for biodiversity protection. So you can see this off the nature of the debate. what is the what is the impacts that they’re all talking about well it’s about whether you can achieve a win-win solution, whether you can achieve economic growth which brings wealth in order to cut poverty without damaging biodiversity, and the argument is that if you want to protect biodiversity you have to focus on that as a goal, but if you do that you have you run the risk of hurting the poor and you also run the risk of inconveniencing or reducing economic growth. And we used in developer to develop country’s industrialized countries to seeing this argument. This axis argued about with let us say a government wishing to start drilling for oil in place X which is full of Wildlife and the Wildlife. Conservation Society is urging them not to on the grounds, that it’s a wilderness refuge. We used to that debate what I’m saying is it in the developing world there’s a third axis and it’s quite a complex one."
