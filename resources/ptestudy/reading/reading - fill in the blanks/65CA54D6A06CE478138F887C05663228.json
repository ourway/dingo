    "text": "Everybody needs fresh water.without water people, animals & plants cannot live. Although a few plants and animals can make do with saltwater, all humans need a constant supply of fresh water to stayfit& healthy. Of the total supply of water on the Earth, only about 3% of it is fresh, & most of that is stored as ice & snow at the poles, or is sodeep under the surface of the Earth that we cannot get to it. Despite so much of the water being out of reach, we still have a million cubic miles of it that we canuse. Thatâ€™s about 4,300,000 cubic kilometers of freshwater to share out between most of the plants, animals & people on the planet!"
