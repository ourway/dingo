    "text": "There are 562 federally recognized American Indian tribes, with a total of 1.7 million members. Additionally, there are hundreds of groups seeking federal recognition – or sovereignty – though less than ten percent will successfully achieve this status. Federally recognised tribes have the right to self-government, and are also eligible for federal assistance programmes. Exempt from state and local jurisdiction, tribes may enforce their own laws, request tax breaks and control regulatory activities. There are however limitations to their sovereignty including, amongst others, the ability to make war and create currency."
