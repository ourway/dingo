    "text": "There have been many studies in America of the opinions and behavior of university lecturers and professors, and of well-known “free” or public thinkers who are not attached to a university or other  institutions, which show that those who are recognized as being more successful or productive as scholars in their field, or are at the best universities, are much more likely to have critical opinions. That is to say that they are more likely to hold liberal views – in the American use of that word – than those of their colleagues  who are less creative or who have less of a reputation . The better a university is, as measured by the test results of its students or by the prestige of its staff , the more likely it has been that there will be student unrest and a relatively left-of-center faculty."
