    "text": "Today we are going to talk some more about architecture and what makes for a good design. There are of course a whole range of qualities that most architects would like their buildings to possess. One of these is the durability of the building. Architects must consider how well the building will stand up to the ravages of climate and time. Will it remain robust and in good condition? Clearly, requirements will vary according to the surroundings of the building in question. A design that is suitable for Dubai will have different needs from one for Moscow. Then of course itâ€™s essential to consider the appearance of the building.Regardless of what its purpose may be, will people find pleasure in looking at it! An original and still respected writer on architecture, the Roman Vitrtlvius, wrote in the first century that a building should delight people and should raise their spirits. Again. tastes may vary from one society to the next, but the prinCiple remains the same."
