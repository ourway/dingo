And they’re known to haveinfectedsome 2,000 people in 48 states this year. At least 87 people have died from the infection, which can cause swelling in the brain. Almost half of the cases have been in Texas. And to lower the risk of infection, some areas have taken extreme measuresincluding aerial pesticide spraying.
