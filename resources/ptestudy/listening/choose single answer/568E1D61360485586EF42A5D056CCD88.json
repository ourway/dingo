    "text": "Animals as well as humans are affected by noise. There is evidence to show that some whales. for example, died when they beached themselves after being exposed to excessive sonar the noise produced by submarines as they navigate underwater. It’s been shown that whales produced louder sounds when communicating with each other when sonar equipment was on in their vicinity. This was doubtless because they needed to make themselves heard by their fellows, perhaps to warn each other of danger, or tell one another about a food source. Another example of how noise can affect animal behaviour is given by the European robin. In urban areas this small bird sings at night rather than during the day."
