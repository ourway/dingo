    "text": "Families are always related to the economy, the politics, the culture of the society. In  herding societies young people go out when they’re 10 or 12 years old and they hang out with the sheep or the goats – or whatever the herd is. That produces a kind of a(an) loose bond between the preadolescences and their parents. In industrial societies, we tend to keep kids in school for longer and then college is that point when they might break – or after college, depending on what they’re doing. In agrarian societies families have lots of kids and put them to work. They structure themselves as large families and put them all together in one home. The main point is that families are not separate from the society. Families and the economy and the politics are all wrapped up all together."
