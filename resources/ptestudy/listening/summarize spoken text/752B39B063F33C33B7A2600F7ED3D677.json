This is very interesting because an animal survives and reproduce mainly involves factors which include temperature tolerance, body size, behavior, and the altitude they live in. Here is an example: Imagine animals that can survive only in hot environment. Now if these same animals are put into a freeze, you will notice it will die very soon. Those species who have tolerance temperature to code can only survive. This is why climate and seasons are quite important for animalsâ€™ survival. Various species have to maintain their body and, on the water, and tolerate different temperature in various seasons. Finally, I would like to point out that some of these species or animals can adapt to climate change by changing their behavior in daily activity in the habitat they live in."
