    "text": "Those of you who’ve never heard the term “neo-Latin” may be forgiven for thinking it’s a new South American dance craze. If you’re puzzledwhen I tell you it has something to do with the language of Romans, take heart, over the years many classes who haveconfessedthey are not really sure what it is either. Some have confessed that they are so-called ‘Late-Latin’, written at the end of the Roman Empire. Others have supposed it must have something to do with the middle ages. Or perhaps it’s that pseudo-Latin which my five and seven-year-old boys seem to havegleanedfrom the Harry Potter books, useful for spells and curses that they zip one another with makeshift paper ash ones. No, in fact, neo-Latin is more or less the same as the Latin that was written in theancientworld, classical Latin. So, what’s so new about it?"
