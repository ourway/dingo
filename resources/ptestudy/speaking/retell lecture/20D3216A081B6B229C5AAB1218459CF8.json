I think security is very important. It’s a society that has democracy as its basic values. There are people who come from a third world which wasn’t a British colony where they didn’t have democracy such way they grew up under what I called a law lord. A system where the king or the local headman was the ruler of that particular area and he laid down the laws. And there are still parts of Africa as well as Middle East where the system still exists. They have to follow that ritual and that’s it, they cannot argue against it. Well, in our British society, we can argue. As the American saying, we can fight the city hall and this is one thing which is very unique among the western civilization. Is that any voice is heard, however small is, however big is, we have the equal authority."
