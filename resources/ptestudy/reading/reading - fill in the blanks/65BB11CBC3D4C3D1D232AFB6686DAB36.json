    "text": "Dance has played an important role in many musicals. In some  cases dance numbers are included as an excuse to add to the color and  spectacle of the show, but dance is more  effective when it forms an integral part of the plot. An early example is Richard Rodgers On Your Toes (1936) in which the story about classical ballet meeting the world of jazz enabled dance to be  introduced  in a way that  enhances , rather than  interrupts  the drama."
