    "text": "Florida’s Everglades are home to lots of large wading birds, like egrets and herons. But the Glades also have lots of raccoons and possums. For the mammals, the birds’ nests are an all-you-can-eat buffet. And when an invasion occurs,” sometimes thousands of birds will abandon their nests. And leave, and there is littered remains of dead chicks and eggs that have been eaten.” Stated Lucas Nell, an ecologist at the University of Georgia."
