    "text": "Art De Vany is 62, but physical fitness tests three years ago showed he had the body of a 32-year-old. De Vany’s advice to the modern exercise freak is to cut duration and frequency, and increase intensity. ‘Our muscle fibre composition reveals that we are adapted to extreme intensity of effort’, says De Vany, a professor of economics at the Institute of Mathematical Behavioural Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. His approach to fitness combines Darwinian thinking with his interest in chaos theory and complex systems."
