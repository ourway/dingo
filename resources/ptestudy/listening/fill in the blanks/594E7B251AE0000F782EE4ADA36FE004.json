    "text": "Teamwork can also lead toinconsistency  – a common cause of poor sales. In the case of a smartphone that a certain company launched  one director wanted to target the business market, and another demanded it was aimed . at consumers. The company wanted both directors to be involved , so gave the product a consumer-friendly name, but marketed it to companies. The result was that it met the needs of neither group. It would have been better to let one director or the other have his way, not both. Now industriousness  or hard work. It’s easy tomock  people who say they work hard."
