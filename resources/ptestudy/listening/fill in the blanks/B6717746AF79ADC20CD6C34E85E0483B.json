    "text": "Most likely a Mars mission will require transporting most of the necessary supplies and equipment by unmanned spacecraft to the chosen landing area and  confirming  their operable condition before the first astronautseven arrive. During their long, confined stay, the Mars pioneers may live in an inflatable modular housing unit as a possible replacement for the U.S. crew quarters on the International Space Station. The cylindrical structure would be 27 ft. in  diameter and have a foot-thick protective shell when inflated . The shell would be made of almost two dozen layers of material that is stronger than steel. It would also provide insulation from the extreme Martian temperatures that range from-128.3°C during the polar night to 26.6°C at the  equator  . The module would consist of four levels, for work, health care, crew quarters, and a galley area. The space travelers will drive for miles across the planet’s diverse terrain in advanced-type roving vehicles equipped with specialized tools, drills, and analytical instruments. Much of their time will be spent searching for water and past and present evidenceof Martian life forms, and conducting a wide range of scientific activities that cannot be accomplished by robotic exploration."
