    "text": "A volcano is event in the earth which erupts when hot liquefied rock or magma moves to the earth surface poured out as lava. the lever may flow out as a liquid or it may explode from the vent as solid or liquid particles accompanied by superheated gases. Ash and cinders form a cone around the vent. There are several types of volcanoes the most fluid magmas erupt quietly and flow from the vent to form gently sloping shield volcanoes. The name shield volcano comes from their resemblance to the shields of early Germanic warriors. 11 flows from shield volcanoes are usually only 1 to 10 m thick that may extend for great distances from the vent. The volcanoes of Hawaii and Iceland are typical volcanoes of this type. cinder cone volcanoes are formed when magmas with high gas contents and high viscosity are blown high into the air during an eruption. The magma falls as volcanic bombs, which accumulate around the vent and form steep sided cones called Erez large basin like depressions are formed when a violent eruption blows the top off of an existing cone or when the center of a volcano collapses. one famous Caldera covers much of Yellowstone National Park. 600,000 years ago, there was a huge volcanic explosion which devastated the landscape. At the center, there remained only smoldering Caldera a collapsed crater more than 40 miles wide. Yellowstoneâ€™s famous geysers and hot springs lie within this giant basin."
