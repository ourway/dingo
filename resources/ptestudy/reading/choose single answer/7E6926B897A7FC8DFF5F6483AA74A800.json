    "text": "The premise of the Hollywood film The Core (2003) is impossible. Pressures deep in the Earth would crush any probe that we could imagine carrying humans. But Prof. David Stevenson of Caltech has an idea, albeit unlikely, for getting instruments to the core of the Earth. It involves starting with a deep crack in the crust and pouring into it 100 000 tonnes of molten iron. He believes that the dense liquid would force its way down through the mantle over a week or two, and if it were to carry small, heat resistant instruments the size of grapefruit, they could continue to send readings back to the surface using seismic waves, all the way to the outer core where they would eventually melt."
