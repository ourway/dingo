    "text": "One family generally dines on Chinese takeout while their neighbours eat home cooked meatloaf. You say potato, I say potato. And humans aren’t the only primate  species with cultural differences: even in the same  environmentdifferent groups of chimpanzees use different tools. The work is in Current Biology. Chimps living in a national park in Cote d’Ivoire like eating Coula nuts. They hammer them open with stone or wood. At the beginning of the season, the nutshells are harder. So you might expect all the chimps in the forest to initially use stone hammers and then switch to easy to-find wooden tools when the nut cracking requires less force. But researchers examined the tool use of three different chimpanzee  communities and found that despite sharing genes and a habitat, each group chose their hammers differently. For example, one group preferred stone hammers throughout the Coula nut season. Another gradually transitioned from primarily stone to primarily wooden tools. And the third community switched from stone to wood more quickly. Hammer size also varied from group to group. As a chimp might explain, you say tomato, I say “chimpanzee calls”."
