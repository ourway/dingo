    "text": "A long-term study pertaining to acidic rainfall was carried out by the University of Illinois researchers. According to the study emissions regulations certainly appear to have a considerable impact on our environment. Various samples of rainfall were collected from over 250 stations across the States on a weekly basis by The National Atmospheric Deposition Program. The vital purpose behind collecting the samples was to analyze the pollutants these samples contained. Followed by the analysis, a full report was released by the department which encapsulates details of the frequency of acid rain and the concentration over a period of 25 years between 1984 to 2009. One of the researchers named Chris Lehmann opined that this was one of the longest term and vital precipitation study program. He also added that regulations on emissions have been observed to have a direct and positive impact on pollution control in rainfall which will have a significant impact on pollution control in the long run. He further explained that rainfall chemistry does have a direct correlation with air pollution."
