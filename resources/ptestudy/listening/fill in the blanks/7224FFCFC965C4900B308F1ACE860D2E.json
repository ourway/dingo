    "text": "Hi everybody, it’s Joe Biden. I delivered  a report to President Obama laying out how far we’ve come since he put me in charge of the Cancer Moonshotthat was back in January and lay out a real vision for where we need to go in the immediate future to: to do in five years what would otherwise take ten; to inject a real sense of urgency into the fight against cancer; and to change the culture and reimagine our system in order to be able to win. When President Nixon  declared war on cancer in 1971, he had no army, he had no resources, and no clear strategy . But after 45 years of progress, funding research, training scientists and physicians, and treating millions of patients — we now have the army. We now have tools, powerful tools. And with this Moonshot, we now have a clear strategy for the road ahead. It matters, folks  , because there’s a consensus now that we’re at an inflection point with science, medicine, and technology all advancing faster than ever and offering real promise . We can’t play by the rules of 1971 — we didn’t have this working for us."
