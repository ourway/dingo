    "text": "Negotiation is a common process in business to mainly solve business conflicts between both parties. Compromise is a basic negotiation strategy in which both parties give up something that they want in order to get something else they want more. Compromise usually occur in unfair parties when there is a fixed pie to be divided up, and whatever on one side gets, the other side loses. In compromise situations, neither side gets all of what they really want, but they each make concessions in order to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both. Both parties usually can reach win-win concept through compromise.  However, negotiation cannot resolve all the conflict if one party is unwilling to resolve the problem."
