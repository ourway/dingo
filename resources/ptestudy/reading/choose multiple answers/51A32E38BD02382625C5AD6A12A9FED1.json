    "text": "Genetic studies are the latest technique in a long effort of modern humans to find out where they have come from. But however the paths are traced, the basic story is simple: people have been moving since they were people. If early humans hadnâ€™t moved and intermingled as much as they did, they probably would have continued to evolve into different species. From beginnings in Africa, most researchers agree, groups of hunter-gatherers spread out, driven to the ends of the Earth.To demographer Kingsley Davis, two things mad migration happen. First, human being, with their tools and language, could adapt to different conditions without having to wait for evolution to make them suitable for a new niche. Second, as population grew, cultures began to differ, and inequalities developed between groups. The first factor gave us the keys to the door of any room on the planet; the other gave us reasons to use them.Over the centuries, as agriculture spread across the planet, people moved toward places where metal was found and worded and to centers of commerce that then became cities. Those places were, in turn, invaded and overrun by people later generations called barbarians."
