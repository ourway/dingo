    "text": "One of the characteristics of ‘good’ information identified earlier was that it should be ‘balanced’. In an  ideal  world, ‘objective’ or ‘balanced’ information would present all the evidence for and against, and leave you to  weigh  this up and draw  conclusions . In the real world, however, we recognize that all information presents a position of interest, although this may not necessarily be intentional. Objectivity may therefore be an unachievable ideal. This means that the onus is on you as the reader and user of the information to develop a  critical  awareness of the positions represented in what you read, and to take  account  of this when you interpret the information. In some cases, authors may  explicitly  express a particular viewpoint – this is perfectly valid as long as they are open about the perspective they represent. Hidden bias, whether or not it is  deliberate , can be misleading."
