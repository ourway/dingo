    "text": "As a kindergarten teacher might say, sharing is caring. She might not mentionthat cooperation is also a great way to form a community, and thus improve everyone’s chances of survival. Humans aren’t the only ones to apply this strategy marine bacteria also form cooperative populations, according to a study in the journal Science. Researchers examinedthe genomes of bacteria belonging to the Vibrionaceae family. In the lab, they grouped together bacteria with similar geneticsthat coexist in the same micro-habitat. The scientists expected that within any given population, individuals capable of producing antibioticswould use these chemical weapons against others. But when they looked at interactionsbetween different strains of Vibrionaceae, they found that only a few members of any given population could produce the bacteria-killing substances, and the rest of that community was resistant to those particularcompounds. But the antibiotics could fight off foreign populations, while leaving members of the home group unharmed. This arrangementimplies a bacterial social structure where individuals help the group as a whole. Crayon-hoarding toddlers might want to take note."
