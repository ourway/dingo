  },
  {
    "text": "Signs advertising business premises have been around for thousandsof years and were used in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome to attract customers; and they often used symbols to illustrate what ldndof business it was – for example, bushes or branches of ivy meantthe place was a tavern. Both of these, the tavern and its sign, were introduced into Britain by the Romans in the first half of the 1st century AD. In Europe in the Middle Ages signs became more common, then, in the 14th century, English merchants were obliged to have them outside their shops. However, the fashion was to have large swinging signs hung from a strut sticking out of the wall – and many public houses still have such signs– but so many accidents occurred, mostly involving people on horseback, that in the 17th centurya law was brought in requiring shopkeepers to mount their signs flat against the wall of the premises, where they could do no harm."
