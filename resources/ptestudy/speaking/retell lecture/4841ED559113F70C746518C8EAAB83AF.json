In fact, forty percent of people who took part in our survey said they were shy .That’s two out of every five people. And there are studies to indicate that the tendency toward shyness may be inherited. But just because certain children are timid, doesn’t mean they are doomed to be shy forever. There are things parents , teachers, and the children themselves can do to overcome this tendency and even to prevent it. One research in er found that if parents gently push their shy children to try new things, they can help these children become less afraid and less inhibited .Another way to help shy children is to train them in social skills. For example, there are special training groups where children are taught things like looking at other children while talking to them, talking about other people’s interests, and even smiling. These groups have been very successful at giving shy children a place to feel safe and accepted, and at building up their self-esteem."
