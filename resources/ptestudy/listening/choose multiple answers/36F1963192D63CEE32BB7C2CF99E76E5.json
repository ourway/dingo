    "text": "A: Today we have Paul Witner, Head of Theatre Studies here to tell us a bit about the Theatre Studies program. Paul. what makes this course different?B: Well I think it’s the environment we can offer students. We’re a relatively small conservatoire and we offer superb courses in a number of subjects, with an opportunity for performance. We’ve built a reputation for producing both traditional and alternative performances. I guess the course would appeal to potential students for the level of support that’s available. and I mean from the tutors as well as from the fellow students and alumni. There’s a real sense of community.A: So, what are you looking for in prospective students!B: I guess we’re looking for people who are able to cope with the high demands that the course will put on them. In that way, I think the program reflects the workplace we’re preparing them for. so it’s incredibly intense and we cover a huge range of projects, and they will be introduced to areas of performance design which they might never have considered before. We need students with imagination and dedication, who are able to keep up when the going gets tough. It can be demanding but we have to remember that the college enjoys an excellent reputation for student retention, student satisfaction and student employment after graduation."
