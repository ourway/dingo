Napping (2) Whereas the fundamental essence of a daily nap emphasizes the significance of reducing the risk of heart diseases, the corresponding impacts of siesta’s health benefits such as lowering stress levels and reducing heart disease death rates are acknowledged, and the nap hypothesis could be inferred evidently from being a part of the culture, which the potential implications of being less likely to die as well as nap length and cardiovascular diseases prevention are presumed.

New research suggests a midday siesta may reduce a person’s risk of death from heart disease, possibly by lowering stress levels. The findings must be confirmed, but Dimitrios Trichopoulos, MD, a study author, tells us that there is little downside to taking naps — and there could be big health benefits. “The siesta is a victim of progress. Most of us aren’t in the position to take a daily nap,” he says. “But our research suggests that the practice could help protect the heart, and we need further studies to find out if this really is the case.”  Trichopoulos says the research stemmed from the observation that heart disease death rates are lower in Mediterranean and Latin American countries where midday siestas are part of the culture. His own earlier research in a Greek population provided weak evidence in favour of the nap hypothesis, but another, larger study, conducted in Costa Rica failed to show an association.  The newly published Greek study by Trichopoulosl and colleagues from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, and Greece’s University of Athens Medical School is the largest ever to examine the issue in a previously healthy population. A total of 23,681 residents of Greece with no history of heart disease, stroke, or cancer at enrollment were followed an average of 6.3 years. And the study revealed that people who took naps at least three times a week for average of at least 30 minutes were 37% less likely to die of heart disease than people who did not take regular naps."
