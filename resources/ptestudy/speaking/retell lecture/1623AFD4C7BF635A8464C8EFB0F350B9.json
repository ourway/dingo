    "text": "One of the most surprising insights from Einstein is that time is not what we intuitively think it is, right? Most of us have this sense that time for you is the same as time for me. And sometimes there is a cosmic clock that out there taking second after second after second, dragging it’s all in exactly the same way into the future. Einstein found that if you and I are moving relative to each other, however, our clocks don’t take off the time at the same rate. Our watches if they were once in sync if we’re moving relatively to each other, they fall out synchronization. And what is that mean? All that means that what I consider to be happening right now at a given moment, from your perspective that might be the past or might be the future? What you consider to be happening right now to me that may be the past or the future. Now since your view of reality is every bit as valid as my view of reality. That means you cannot really say the past is gone because that might be your now, your reality. You cannot really say that the future is yet to be, maybe the future to me might be your now, your reality at that given moment, so in a sense past, present and future are all equally really, all exist, all out there."
