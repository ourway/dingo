    "text": "DNA barcoding was invented by Paul Hebert of the University of Guelph, in Ontario, Canada, in 2003. His idea was togenerate a unique identification tag for each species based on a shortstretchof DNA. Separating species would then be a simple task of sequencingthis tiny bit of DNA. Dr Herbert proposed part of gene called cytochrome c oxidase I (C01) assuitable to the task. It seems to vary enough, but not too much to act as reliable marker."
